                         The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support the Government of Brazil to
                         improve the coordination and strength the capacity among key federal
                         institutions in the water sector toward an integrated approach. The key institut

                         3. Project Description
                         The proposed Project was designed to consider the following issues: (i) sectoral coordination to
                         achieve a consolidated approach to planning as a means of coherently and systematically identifying
                         long-term investment priorities. It is a Technical Assistance Project and the overall scope of activities
                         has been reduced to ensure they reflect the technical and budgetary capacity of the different agencies
                         to implement the project.
                         The Restructuring proposes the following changes to the Brazil Federal Integrated Water Sector
                         Project (Interaguas), Loan 8074: : (a) partial cancellation of Loan proceeds; (b) changes in the scope,
                         activities and costs; (c) the reallocation of funds among components; (d) revision of the Results
                         Framework; (e) modification to the disbursement estimates; (f) adjustment of the institutional

                         arrangements; and (g) a twenty two month extension of the original Loan closing date from
                         December 31, 2016 to October 31, 2018. The proposed restructuring is necessary to ensure that: the
                         Project responds to the Government➢❨ s strategic priorities, including activities aimed at mitigating
                         the effects of the current water crisis in the Northeast and Southeast regions; expected impacts of
                         such activities are duly reflected in the indicators; and sufficient time is provided for the completion
                         of strategic activities and, ultimately, achievement of the Project Development Objectives.
                         The proposed changes to Project activities are fully aligned with the original Project Development
                         Objectives and Government priorities, and will not affect the achievement of the PDO within the new
                         project implementation period. The overall scope of activities has been reduced to ensure they reflect
                         the technical and budgetary capacity of the different agencies to implement the project. Changes in
                         project components refer to budget allocation. Budget cuts were made on components 1, 2, 3 and 5
                         that were underperforming, whereas the budget allocation was reinforced on component 4 to ensure
                         that in the future more actions will follow an integrated approach. Some activities under component 4
                         have also been dropped as the focus of intervention was restricted to SÃ£o Francisco river basin
                         (originally was also envisaged studies related with the Araguaia-Tocantins river basin).
                         Thus, the proposed Project has five components; the first three of them are designed to continue the
                         Bank program of support to ongoing water sector reforms and institutional strengthening in
                         individual sectors at the national level. The description of each component has been revised as
                         follows:
                         The original implementing agencies remain the same, but the Secretariat of Regional Development

                         activities. The inclusion of SDR is a result of new priorities identified by the Ministry of National
                         Integration in response to the ongoing water security and drought response activities in the Northeast.

                         SDR activities will mainly focus on the strategy for rural water supply activities and the development
                         of instruments to strengthen a national drought policy.
                         The description of each component has been revised as explained in the paragraphs below.

                         analysis (if known)
                         The area of influence of the project is located throughout the entire area of the Federative Republic
                         of Brazil, with Component 4 specifically focused on the SÃ£o Francisco river basin. The SÃ£o
                         Francisco (635,000 km2) is a large multi-state river basin under high water demand pressure for
                         multiple uses. In the SÃ£o Francisco, most of the hydropower potential has been developed but some
                         increase in irrigation is expected. The river basin committee is active and the basin is close to start
                         charging for bulk water. The key challenges in this basin are water allocation conflicts from
                         competing demands and inter-basin transfers.
                         The Project will strengthen the institutional capacity of the project implementing agencies regarding

                         social and environmental issues. The original implementing agencies remain the same, but the
                         Secretariat of Regional Development (SDR) will be included under the Ministry of National
                         Integration as a beneficiary of Project's activities. The inclusion of SDR is a result of new priorities
                         identified by the Ministry of National Integration in response to the ongoing water security and
                         drought response activities in the Northeast. SDR activities will mainly focus on the strategy for rural
                         water supply activities and the development of instruments to strengthen a national drought policy.

                         Administered by the Bank➢❨ . Procedures for dealing with potential downstream environmental
                         and social impacts have been defined for each one of these typologies and will be followed by the
                         client and properly described on the Terms of Reference for each activity.
                         The Project is expected to have positive environmental impacts by improving the capacity of
                         government water sector institutions and focusing on integrated planning across sectors to achieve
                         the sustainable management and use of water resources. Project activities are designed to enhance
                         and provide protection to the environmental functioning of the predominant ecological system,
                         protect the wetland biodiversity and implement strategic activities that address the root causes of
                         environmental degradation. The strengthening of basin institutions responsible for WRM, the
                         generation and dissemination of information and the integration of environmental concerns into
                         water basin economic development activities on a sustainable basis are key elements of this
                         Project.
                         Irrigation investments that will be studied through the Project could, if eventually financed, help to
                         promote more sustainable and efficient irrigation methods, diversify the agricultural economy,
                         raise employment, reduce social pressures on land, increase income for farmers and promote the
                         export of agricultural products within Brazil and abroad. Water supply and sanitation measures are
                         expected to facilitate extending household connections to the potable water and sanitation systems
                         as well as constructing wastewater treatment plants. Greater access to WSS services will
                         contribute to improved health, environmental and urban development indicators throughout the
                         country.
                         The climate change and adaptation and mitigation strategies supported through the Project could
                         also play a crucial role in the future. Climate change is expected to exacerbate the frequency and

                         migration from the arid regions of the northeast to the coastal cities, aggravating water pollution
                         and water and sanitation service provision issues in these already strained urban environments.

                         consistently considered Low due to the Technical Assistance nature of the activities supported by
                         the Project. Nevertheless, given the potentially category A downstream activities that may result
                         from project studies, plans and policies of water resources management, the risk rating has been
                         upgraded to Moderate.

                           These frameworks were discussed during the public consultations held in Brasilia on 27 August,
                           2010 with close to 120 representatives of various governmental and civil society organizations.
                           The main government institutions are sufficiently staffed and their capacity to implement these
                           norms is considered adequate.
                           The Project Technical Secretariat (Secretaria TÃ©cnica do Programa, STP), created within ANA,
                           will take a leading role to coordinate the different project activities at the federal, basin and state
                           levels. STP will also provide support to all operational aspects of the Project and monitor and
                           evaluate all the interventions undertaken to ensure that they meet the targets, timetables and

                           the PROAGUA water management component will serve to provide the leadership and ensure
                           knowledge transfer to the participating agencies. Each state also has an active Public Ministry to
                           oversee public sector compliance with its own norms and procedures.
                           In addition, efforts to build capacity in the implementation of the frameworks is also included as
                           part of the project.
                           Finally, Bank supervision will closely follow the progress in streamlining social and
                           environmental concerns during the implementation phase.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                             Key stakeholders include the four participating federal institutions (MMA, MI, MC and ANA) as
                           well as state-level water resources councils, basin committees, federal, state and municipal bodies
                           responsible for water resources management and water agencies. During the 27 August, 2010
                           project preparation consultations with key stakeholders including municipal authorities, ministry
                           officials, and representatives from civil society were carried out to discuss project objectives and
                           potential impacts. ANA made a detailed description of each of the components and the consultants
                           undertaking the social and environmental assessments discussed the main points of the proposed
                           frameworks.
                           Feedback and questions from the participants indicates that the main public concerns involve
                           project design and implementation issues. At the conclusion of the consultation, the Government
                           ensured participants that their recommendations would be used to revise the final project
                           documents, and that additional suggestions can always be made by visiting the project website
                           http://interaguas.ana.gov.b       r/Paginas/default.aspx. Lastly, at the community level, the
                           beneficiary stakeholders will be engaged in the design and implementation of the local
                           interventions and will benefit from social outreach and environmental/sanitary promotion
                           campaigns, which are designed to promote the sustainability of interventions at this level.

                           Based on these consultations potential negative impacts and mitigation measures were identified
                           and agreed with the government, as well as a plan for periodic consultations as program
                           implementation progresses. To ensure effective transfer of knowledge and use of best practices at
                           the sub-national level, this component will include a strong communication program with
                           workshops and seminars to inform all the relevant stakeholders at the basin, state and federal
                           levels.
