                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The development objective is to strengthen the disaster resilience of Southern African member states through regional
                           collaboration and improved coordination, planning, policy advisory and knowledge dissemination capacity of SADC.
                           The project will accelerate the effective implementation of an African Comprehensive disaster risk reduction and risk
                           management framework in the SADC region.

                           C. Project Description
                           The program “Building Disaster Resilience to Natural Hazards in Sub-Saharan African Regions, Countries and
                           Communities”, which is financed by the ACP – EU through the 10th EDF Program of the European Union was launched
                           in 2015. It is implemented along five result areas by several partners, including the African Development Bank (AfDB),
                           African Union Commission (AUC), the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) and
                           GFDRR / World Bank. Result area 2, which is managed by GFDRR / World Bank, supports four Regional Economic
                           Communities (RECs), including SADC, in Sub-Saharan Africa to “have DRR coordination, planning and policy advisory
                           capacities operational to support their respective member states and regional and sub-regional programs”. The

                           program will provide targeted support to RECs to strengthen their capacities for improved coordination, planning,
                           policy advisory and knowledge dissemination to advance the regional Disaster Risk Management (DRM) agenda and
                           better support their respective member states in taking informed decisions in building resilience to disasters.

                           The program “Building Disaster Resilience to Natural Hazards in Sub-Saharan African Regions, Countries and
                           Communities” will be implemented as a SADC specific project in three phases, over a period of 4 years until December
                           31st 2019. Phase 1 will have 24 months duration, phase 2 will cover 18 months and phase 3 will cover 6 months. The
                           total budget available for SADC is US$ 5 million. The following describes the overall budget for the project for the five
                           components and the overall implementation as recipient and Bank executed activities.

                           Component 1: Enhancing regional disaster preparedness and response institutional and coordination mechanisms (US$
                           670,000 RE; US$ 935,000 BE) The project will include the development, roll out and continued support to member
                           states for a regional disaster preparedness and response plan and to carry out a feasibility study for the SADC
                           Humanitarian and Emergency Operations Center linked to member states and UN agencies and conduct the related
                           capacity building for this program.

                           Component 2: Operationalizing national and regional DRR information and knowledge management systems (US$
                           475,000 RE; US$ 455,000 BE). This component will support SADC to establish and roll out a regional and national level
                           hazard alert system and facilitate the harmonization of a regional disaster management information mechanism.

                           Component 3: Strengthening the regional DRR policy advocacy and capacity development program (US$ 875,000 RE;
                           US$ 750,000 BE). The project will support SADC and member states to align national and regional strategies, polices
                           and plans of action with the in 2015 agreed Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The project component will
                           furthermore foresee a number of national and regional level capacity building and research initiatives. This initiative
                           would among others be implemented through a university and research partnership program.

                           Component 4: Enhancing Mainstreaming of DRR in development plan and strategies (US$ 150,000 RE; US$ 30,000 BE).
                           The component will provide resources for strategic and targeted support for DRR mainstreaming and investment
                           planning.

                           Component 5: Strengthening the implementation and coordination capacity at the SADC Secretariat (US$ 580,000 RE;

                           The following activities are foreseen under the first phase, Recipeint executed of the project (this specific project):

                                1. Staffing and operational costs of the Project Implementation Unit, including a Senior DRM Specialist, a DRM
                                   Information Management Specialist, DRM Policy Specialist and Project Assistant.
                                2. Carry out a feasibility study and develop a road map for the establishment of the SADC Humanitarian and
                                   Emergency Operations Center (HEOC), linking SADC to member states’ HEOC, the UN disaster Assessment and
                                   Coordination System and the regional interagency standing committee.
                                3. Support member states in re-aligning DRR policies, legislation and strategies to the Sendai framework for DRR
                                   and the African Union Plan of Action for DRR;
                                4. Facilitate a national and regional peer review mechanism for sharing knowledge and best practices on DRR.

                          analysis (if known)
                          The project is a technical assistance activity and will be implemented at and through the secretariat of the SADC
                          Secretariat. Certain activities, such as the proposed study on trans-boundary effects of disasters in Southern Africa will
                          address issues, such as flooding in the 15 member states of SADC. These studies will however remain at the level of
                          detail of “pre-feasibility” studies. Besides office space renovations and the installation of servers and computer inside
                          the buildings of the SADC secretariat in Gaborone and decentralized offices of SADC no activities will be implemented,
                          which have any physical impact on any site.




                          E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                          SADC has already implemented already a number of World Bank financed projects in the previous years. Nevertheless,
                          SADC’ capacity to address and manage environmental and social safeguard related issues remains limited. Specifically,
                          the DRR department has not yet managed a World Bank financed project. The project will therefore establish a small
                          Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to support the implementation of the project. If deemed necessary the PIU could be
                          strengthened with specialists to take care of safeguard relevant issues during project implementation.
