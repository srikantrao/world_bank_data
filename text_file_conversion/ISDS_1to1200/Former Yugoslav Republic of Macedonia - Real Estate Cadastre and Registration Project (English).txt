A.2. Project Objectives 
The objective of the project is to build an efficient and effective real estate cadastre and 
registration system, contributing to the development of efficient land and real estate 
markets. The focus of the project will be: (i) accelerating the establishment of the real 
estate cadastre (REC) and the registration of rights; (ii) improving processes and 
procedures through re-engineering of office functions and introducing automation and IT 
technology to provide efficient registration services through the establishment, 
implementation and monitoring of minimum service standards of property registration 
transactions; (iii) improving the institutional capacity and human resources of SAGW 
through the development and implementation of a strategic management plan and human 
resources development plan; and (iv) 
develo
p
ing the government’s capacity to formulate 
Page  2
policies in order to achieve efficient property markets.   
 
By 2010 the following are the expected outcome of the project:  1) the REC covers the 
whole territory of Macedonia; 2) completed REC and registration of rights in urban and 
peri-urban areas; 3) streamlined procedures for converting land cadastre to real estate 
cadastre (conversion of possession rights to ownership rights) in rural areas; 4) all 
transactions are registered in 1 day in all SAGW offices; 5) SAGW is self-financing and 
operating according to modern business practices;  6) all cadastral surveying is done 
through private surveyors; and 7) there is a well functioning mechanism in government to 
formulate land policies. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project components are:     
 
a. 
Completing the Real Estate Cadastre
This component will support the 
completion of real estate cadastre and registration of rights in urban and peri-
urban areas in the country by 2010. The component will include three 
subcomponents: (i) operational support for completion of the REC, including 
base mapping, cadastral re-survey, support for systematic adjudication and 
registration of real rights, and rationalization of registration procedures; and (ii) 
public awareness campaign for REC (systematic registration).  
 
b. 
Institutional Development and Improving Service Delivery
The objective of this component is 
to transform SAGW into a modern and efficient national cadastre and registration agency, and  
improve service delivery of all local and regional offices with a goal to complete the registration 
of all transactions in 1 day by the end of the project.  This component includes the following sub-
components: (i) institutional development of SAGW which will focus on developing SAGW as 
an efficient and public service oriented agency with the goal of self-financing; (ii) promoting 
trans
parency and accountability through the issuance of  “customer bill of rights”, establishment 
of a hotline for customer complaints, and strengthening internal investigation of corruption and 
misconduct.; (iii) improving registration services for the public which will focus on SAGW local 
offices and customer service for secondary transactions; (iv) development of automated 
registration and cadastre system; and (v) education and training for SAGW staff as well as the 
nascent private sector surveyors.         
c. 
Development of Land Policy
This component will support the government capacity to develop 
policies and regulatory framework to ensure completion of land and real estate cadastre and full 
functioning of  land and real estate markets through: (i)  the development of government capacity 
to coordinate the formulation of land and real estate policies through consultative processes; and 
(ii) studies and formulation of specific priority policies in the areas of:  protection of ownership 
rights of registered land and real estate cadastre, regularization of informal settlements, access 
and fee structure of real estate cadastre information for other public and private entities, policies 
to promote the use of  ownership and lease rights of rural land for collateral, land fragmentation, 
Page  3
registration of illegal buildings, provision and access of land for investment, land use planning 
and development control policies, tax and fee structure for registration of property transaction. 
The component will also provide resources to drafting  regulations once the policies are adopted. 
 
d. 
Project Management
The component will include: (i) support to SAGW to manage the project 
through financing the PMU expenses including contract staff; and (ii) monitoring and evaluation.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
As the goal of the project is to complete the real estate cadastre across the country with 
the focus in the first two to three years on completing the urban and peri-urban areas. 
Land cadastre will be converted in rural areas into Real Estate Cadastre once simplified 
procedures are approved and adopted. This is expected to be done in the last two years of 
the project.

], B [X ], C [ ], FI [ ] 
 
Comments: 
 
Though most of ECA land administration projects have historically been rated as 
category C and no environmental impact assessment was required, the project will be 
rated a low category “B” and a brief environmental management plan was prepared 
during project preparation. A social assessment was prepared and a study on ethnic issues 
and gender were also undertaken as part of project preparation.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The principle environmental issues are: 1) potential construction/renovation of small 
office buildings; 2) potential long term negative impact of registration of rights in the 
absence of proper land use planning and control systems in place, especially in 
environmentally sensitive areas. On the construction of buildings, the construction 
contracts will include environmental guidelines to ensure adequate environmental 
measures are employed during construction. On the issue of potential impact on land use, 
the project will finance, under the land policy component, a study on the land use and 
development control policies in Macedonia. Registration of rights in forest and other 
protected areas will only be done once management plans are discussed and agreements 
reached between the occupants and government agencies. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
None. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Registration of ownership rights for private forest were considered. However, during 
preparation, it was clear that registration of rights without management plans are in place 
could cause non sustainable use for forest. Therefore, it was agreed that registration of 
rights in forest and other environmental sensitive areas would only be done after 
management plans are discussed and agreed between the beneficiaries and the relevant 
government institution.  
 
In addition to ensure that Roma communities who live on state land, the project will only 
register ownership rights only if the government would like to transfer the land from state 
to individual households who live on this land. In case the government does not wish to 
do so, the project will not register ownership rights in the name of the state.  
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Registration of rights in and around forest and other environmental sensitive areas will be 
coordinate with the ministry of environment and ministry of agriculture and forestry to 
ensure that management plans are in place.  Registration of ownership rights of properties 
Page  6
of  cultural heritage significance will be coordinated with the Ministry of Culture and the 
Agency for the Protection of Cultural Properties.    
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Consultations are planned with the key stakeholders on the safeguard issues in 
November, 2004 before the arrival of the appraisal mission.
