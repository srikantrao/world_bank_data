B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The objective of the Project is to support planned and sustainable urban growth and to increase the 
availability of serviced land in selected urban areas of Bhutan. This will be achieved through financing 
construction of critical infrastructure systems such as water supply, drainage, and access roads in 
currently under-serviced areas, and through strengthening capacity of central and local institutions to 
manage urban growth and to deliver infrastructure services.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The Project will consists of 2 components: (i) technical assistance (TA), and (ii) actual investments in 
infrastructure. Thus, investment loan is considered to be the best instrument for the Project. 
 
In response to the Government’s request the Project will address the most pressing infrastructure needs in 
Thimphu and a perhaps a few smaller regional towns.  The following regional towns have tentatively 
been proposed by RGOB – Autsho (Lhuntshe district), Demtsi (Mongal district) and Kanlung (Tashigang 
district). The final selection of Project locations will be made based on specific criteria to be mutually 
agreed between the Government and the Bank. 
 
Component 1: Technical Assistance
.
This component will include consultancy services to the Ministry of 
Works and Human Settlement and Thimphu City Corporation (TCC) as well as concerned Dzongkhag 
Administrations in planning, implementing, and managing infrastructure investments. This component 
will also aim at strengthening the institutional capacity of the participating city/towns, especially TCC, in 
Page  2
the areas of urban planning, land use regulation, land registration, municipal finance, O&M of 
infrastructure services, urban environmental management, etc.  
 
Component 2: Investments in Infrastructure
.
This component will provide financing for investments in 
physical infrastructure in the selected Project locations. The priority investments will be urban roads, 
water supply and sanitation, and drainage. The focus of this component will be on Thimphu, with a few 
other towns possibly included. RGOB has identified potential investments in the two of the proposed 
towns 
–
Thimphu and Autsho. However, the specific investments in each location will be identified based 
on detailed feasibility studies and extensive consultations with the respective stakeholders. In Thimphu, 
prioritization of 10 Local Areas will likely be required.  
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
[Guideline:  If the location is not yet identified, please indicate if there are alternative locations 
under consideration or how the location is to be determined during project preparation] 
The project will be implemented in Thimphu and a perhaps a few smaller regional towns.  The following 
regional towns have tentatively been proposed by RGOB – Autsho (Lhuntshe district), Demtsi (Mongal 
district) and Kanlung (Tashigang district). The final selection of Project locations will be made based on 
specific criteria to be mutually agreed between the Government and the Bank. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
[Guideline: Based on past experience and other available information]
 
The Borrower is keen to ensure that safeguard policies are adhered to. RGOB’s National Environment 
Commission has published Environmental Codes of Practice for urban infrastructure services and reviews 
and clears all proposals for new infrastructure development. However, institutional capacity for 
environmental monitoring at local level is weak, especially in Dzongkhag administrations, and the 
proposed project will strengthen such a capacity. 
 
On the social side, the Borrower is struggling to come up with the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) under 
the ongoing Urban Development Project and the implementation of RAP is a non starter so far.  There is a 
need for a fresh look at the difference between Borrower’s policies and Bank’s requirements in terms of 
compensation for resettlement and land acquisition.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS would 
be prepared. 
–
August 2005 
 
B.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  The 
specific studies and their timing
1
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
Overall, the project is expected to have positive environmental and social impacts by supporting 
sustainable urban growth and improving environmental services.  Potential negative environmental 
impacts associated with construction of new infrastructure systems such as water supply and urban 
drainage will be addressed through: (1) site-specific environmental analysis; (2) incorporation of 
environmental monitoring into O&M systems; and (3) institutional strengthening of concerned agencies 
in urban environmental management. 
 
Social analysis and stakeholder consultations will be ensured during the project preparation to maximize 
the positive social impacts and mitigate any negative social impacts.  As part of the project preparation, 
the policy provisions for land acquisition and payment of compensation as well as mitigation measures 
for resettlement and rehabilitation that are adopted for the ongoing project will be reviewed and updated 
consistent with the Bank policy on OP 4.12 Involuntary resettlement and if required, RAP will be 
developed prior to QER.  In addition, the borrower is proposing to use the “Land Pooling Approach” 
wherever possible.  Therefore, appropriate implementation mechanisms will be developed to ensure that 
the land owners are not dis-proparnately affected and share the benefits of the project as a result of 
following the land pooling approach.   
 
The above-mentioned environmental and social analysis will be conducted in combination with the 
feasibility studies for the proposed infrastructure development. It is expected that the analysis will start in 
April 2005 and be completed in August 2005.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the disputed areas

Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the InfoShop and (ii) in-
country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to potentially affected persons.
