B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The Project’s development objectives would be to improve delivery of pensions, increase the 
effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of pension system, establish a modern and efficient pension 
administration system, establish prudently operated voluntary pension pillar, and create conditions that 
would improve the viability of the future introduction of the mandatory funded pillar through: (i) building 
and strengthening institutional capacity of the agencies which manage different parts of the pension and 
social insurance system; (ii) improvement of administrative efficiency and coordination of social 
insurance programs by rationalizing the administrative process and developing an integrated information 
system; and (iii) improving compliance and collection of pension and other social insurance contributions. 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The Project would have the following 5 components: 
 
Consolidation of collection and reporting on contributions and personal income taxes.  
The 
component would include: (i) consolidation of the reporting flows to pension, social insurance funds and 
tax authorities; (ii) creation of the central registry of insured individuals; (iii) integration of collection and 
control functions; and (iv) other improvements in enforcement practices.  The size of this component 
crucially depends on policy decisions regarding integrated reporting on taxes and contributions, 
placement of the collection and administration of the individual monthly contribution records, frequency 
of reporting and roles of the Tax department and social insurance funds in this process.  In either case, the 
component would finance system design, capacity building in the collecting institution, database 
development, design of the new reporting form, its testing, implementation and training of the employers 
in using the new system, development of communication links with all data users and upgrade of their 
systems to enable flows and processing of the data.

Capacity building for the supervision of the voluntary pension system.  
This component 
would support limited assistance staff training, equipment and software, and public education related to 
the development of the voluntary pension system. 
 
Consolidation and institutional strengthening of the PAYGO pension funds.  
This 
component would support the consolidation of the three PAYGO funds along the program adopted by the 
GOS, modernization of the new institution and implementation of a new strategy which would allow it to 
refocus its activities on a narrower range of core functions which it would seek to carry out with 
substantially increased efficiency and security.  This would also facilitate it being an effective partner in 
the broader revenue and reporting consolidation.  The component would also support costs associated 
with retraining of staff associated with transition to a new set of core functions and potential severance 
payment.   
 
Strengthening capacity for policy analysis and development.
 
This component would have a 
goal of improving the policy and analysis capacity of the Pension Department in the MLESP and in the 
MOF.  The component would focus upon building, maintaining, updating and disseminating the pension 
simulation model and development of the capacities for the pension policy modeling, analysis and 
identification in both ministries.  The component would also be used to build capacities in the MLESP, 
provide for needed equipment and adequate office space (if needed), as well as to improve the 
communication of information to broad audiences on pension reform policies.  PARIP would finance the 
design of the education campaign, develop a communication strategy, conduct of the public opinion 
research and limited production of information materials. 
 
Project Coordination and Management.
 
The PMU would consist of a staff of four (Director, 
procurement and financial management staff, and secretary).  Establishment and operations of a PMU 
would include specific TA needed to help prepare the technical specifications and other specialist 
documentation required for the large IT procurements, training of the PIU staff and project audit costs. 
Project Alternatives considered. 
 SWAP. 
 
The option of
 
SWAP was considered, but rejected due to two PALs that included 
pensions.  Following best practice, the two DPLs need to be supported by timely technical assistance and 
investments that assist the Government in developing and implementing the policies to be agreed upon
.
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Mainly in Belgrade  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The borrower has expertise in project implementation but will need to decide on the localization 
and staffing of the new implementation unit(s) and to invest in training of additional staff.
