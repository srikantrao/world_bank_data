                         3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The Project aims to contribute to integrating rural households into sustainable agriculture and forest-
                         based value chains in the project area, which comprises a jurisdictional landscape formed of five
                         districts in Nampula Province and five districts in Zambezia Province. The Project will be structured
                         as a Series of Projects (SoP) and Investment Project Financing, funded by an IDA credit.

                         This Project design recognizes that contributing to integrated sustainable rural development in
                         Mozambique requires simultaneous interventions on several fronts – from addressing barriers to
                         income generation and integration of rural households into agriculture and forest-based value chains
                         (access to finance, technical assistance limited rural infrastructure), to securing land tenure and
                         ensuring the sustainability of natural resources on which rural livelihoods depend. Rural
                         development activities based on agriculture and forestry depend and impact on natural resources, and
                         have to be managed as part of the larger landscape within which local communities, smallholders and
                         investors live and derive their livelihoods from. This requires participatory forms of local land use
                         planning and the promotion of inclusive business models that link communities, small emerging
                         commercial farmers, and investors into sustainable value chains. Practical tools include spatial
                         planning tools (such as GIS-based tools), multi-stakeholder forums to facilitate the construction of
                         common visions on land use, and participatory planning and monitoring tools. All these aspects are
                         embodied in the value chain-focused integrated landscape management approach adopted by the
                         Project in the targeted landscape..

                         The Project would implement this value chain-focused integrated landscape management approach in
                         the targeted area by: (a) promoting households’ integration into agriculture and forests-based value
                         chains with significant market-driven potential as a strategy to promote rural development and raise
                         incomes through the expansion of the SECF network and key agribusiness investments; (b)
                         addressing key financial and infrastructure access constraints related to feeder roads, irrigation and
                         warehousing for relevant stakeholders in the landscape; (c) securing land tenure for communities and

                         rural households in the Project areas; and (d) promoting the adoption of sustainable land use
                         practices (including climate-smart and conservation agriculture), restoring degraded lands in critical
                         areas for the VCs, and improving spatial planning and multi-stakeholder coordination for better
                         management of land use trade-offs.

                         The Project’s components and their specific objectives thus are:
                         1) Agriculture and Forest-Based Value Chain Development – aimed at increasing smallholder and
                         small emerging commercial farmers’ participation in key agriculture and forest-based value chains,
                         as well as enhance targeted value chains’ overall competitiveness, sustainability and resilience. In
                         order to meet the above objectives, the component will support the following activities which will be
                         launched in year 1 of Project implementation:
                         �        Provision of training and technical assistance to Small Emerging Commercial Farmers and
                         key rural SMEs Agribusinesses
                         �        Agribusiness finance to value chain actors. SECFs, Agribusinesses, Weather based
                         insurance.
                         �        Improving rural infrastructure
                         2) Securing Land Tenure Rights and Increasing Natural Resources Resilience – aimed at promoting
                         integrated landscape management, securing land tenure rights of communities and individuals, and
                         protecting, enhancing and restoring critical natural habitats in the targeted landscape. This would be
                         achieved by: (a) strengthening Provincial and District capacity to pursue integrated landscape


                                                                      Page 2 of 11
                         management, including multi-stakeholder platforms, spatial planning and joint planning and
                         monitoring tools; (b) supporting community land delimitation and individual land tenure titling; (c)
                         streamlining land delimitation and titling processes at the Provincial and District levels and

                         strengthening the capacity of Provincial and District offices to issue CDCs and DUATs; and (d)
                         protecting and restoring natural habitats critical for the value chains in the landscape. This
                         component would finance consultants (service providers), goods and operational costs related to
                         delimiting communities and carrying out land titling work, providing needed inputs, equipment and
                         training for landscape restoration, operational costs, and priority civil works in the targeted
                         landscape.
                         3) Project Coordination and Management – aimed at effectively performing the functions of Project
                         coordination and management, fiduciary management, safeguards management, M&E,
                         communications and others. A Project Coordinating Unit (Unidade de Gestão de Fundos
                         Internacionais, UGFI) has been established at MITADER, with significant capacity at the national
                         level. Provincial Implementation Units (PIU) of 4 technical staff have been hired to oversee the
                         implementation of the operation in each Province. A team of decentralized Landscape Facilitators at
                         the provincial and district levels will be deployed at the start of the project.
                         4) Contingency Emergency Response – designed as a “zero-dollar” component to allow the
                         Government of Mozambique, following an adverse event that causes a major disaster, to request the
                         Bank to channel resources from this component into an Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM) by
                         following agreed established procedures. Following an adverse event that causes a major disaster, the
                         GoM may request the Bank to channel resources from this component into an Immediate Response
                         Mechanism (IRM). The IRM would enable the use of a portion of uncommitted funds from the
                         overall IDA portfolio to respond to emergencies. Specific details around this component (including
                         activation criteria, eligible expenditures, and specific implementation arrangements, as well as
                         required staffing for the Coordinating Authority) will be defined in greater detail an IRM Operations
                         Manual, which would go through a consultation and clearance process by project effectiveness.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)

                         The Project area comprises ten districts in Zambézia (Alto Molocue, Ile, Gile, Mocuba and Gurue)
                         and Nampula (Rapale, Lalaula, Mecuburi, Malema and Ribaue), and is characterized by humid
                         mesothermal and sub-humid climates. Three among the thirteen major water basins of the country
                         are located in the Landscape – Lúrio, Ligonha and Licungo. Other water basins found in the
                         Landscape include Mecubúri, Monapo, Mongincual, Monotomo, Meluli, Molócue, Mulela, Nipiode,
                         Raraga and Mungueze. The targeted Landscape coincides also with areas of elevated erosion hazard,
                         based on factors such as slope, soil erodibility, soil erosivity and land cover. There are about 2.9
                         million ha of forest area within the landscape (2014), which is equivalent to about 45% of the
                         Landscape’s total area. From 2000 to 2014, annual deforestation rate has been 0.64 percent, which is
                         well above the national average of 0.58%. The area also encompasses several biodiversity hotspots,
                         having protection status the Gile National Reserve (GNR), managed by the National Conservations
                         Areas Agency (ANAC), and the Mecuburi Forest Reserve, under the responsibility of DINAF in
                         MITADER. Biodiversity hotspots currently with no protection status include Mounts Namuli (Gurue
                         District) and Inago (Malema District).

                         The proposed Project rating is category B type, owing to the nature of its foreseen environmental and
                         social impacts, which are localized and easily manageable. More specifically, the Project triggered
                         the following environmental safeguards: OP/BP 4.01 Environment Assessment, largely because
                         proposed activities under Component 1 and 2 are likely to lead to some environmental and social
                         impacts that would require due safeguards attention. Expected negative impacts can be associated to


                                                                     Page 3 of 11
                         the proposed clearing and rehabilitation of access roads, irrigation infrastructures, storage facilities,
                         water storage infrastructures, irrigations schemes and use of pesticides, including promotion of
                         small-scale farming and land delimitation. Some of the potential foreseen adverse environmental and
Public Disclosure Copy




                         social impacts resulting from the aforementioned activities may lead to soil erosion and degradation,
                         decreased water quality, loss of vegetation, fauna disturbance, deposition of solid wastes, dust
                         emission, social impacts related with loss of land, resource use conflict, impacts on vulnerable and
                         marginalized groups, health and safety of construction workers/artisans. OP/BP 4.36 on Forests was
                         triggered because some of the proposed activities under Component 2 will promote sustainable
                         management of natural forests and forest restoration. Notwithstanding, the Project will not have any
                         direct or indirect negative impacts on health and quality of forests, or the health and safety of people
                         who depends on forests. Likewise, project activities are expected to have significant positive impacts
                         on natural habitats, as the project will promote integrated sustainable natural resource management.
                         OP/BP 4.04 Natural Habitats was triggered owing to the investments aimed at streamlining land
                         delimitation and titling processes while protecting and restoring natural habitats critical for the value
                         chains in the landscape. OP 4.09 on Pest Management was triggered since the Project inputs under
                         Component 1 and 2 may include the use of small quantities of pesticides to boost agriculture
                         productivity, though expected only at a small scale. The Project also preemptively triggers OP/BP
                         4.37 Safe of Dams due to foreseen investments in the rehabilitation of irrigation systems, small water
                         storage and water canals.

                              The ANRLMP has been rated as a Category B project due to the site specific nature of its foreseen
                              environmental and social impacts likely to be caused under Component 1 and 2 which require
                              safeguards attention. The project will not finance activities that may result in major land use
                              changes or natural habitats transformation. The Project triggered the following environmental and
                              social safeguards: OP/BP 4.01 Environment Assessment ; OP/BP 4.36 on Forests because some of
                              the proposed activities under Component 2 will promote sustainable management of natural
                              forests and forest restoration. Notwithstanding, the Project will not have any direct or indirect
                              negative impacts on health and quality of forests, or the health and safety of people who depends
                              on forests; OP/BP 4.04 Natural Habitats was triggered due to the investments aimed at
                              streamlining land delimitation and titling processes while protecting and restoring natural habitats
                              critical for the value chains in the landscape; OP 4.09 on Pest Management triggered since the
                              Project inputs under Component 1 and 2 may include the use of small quantities of pesticides to
                              boost agriculture productivity, though expected only at a small scale; also preemptively the project
                              triggered OP/BP 4.37 Safe of Dams due to foreseen investments in the rehabilitation of irrigation
                              systems, small water storage and water canals; OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement was triggered
                              since project will finance activities associated with land delimitation and/or expansion, land use
                              planning, rehabilitation of small scale irrigation schemes for horticulture construction/
                              rehabilitation of small-scale infrastructure (storage and administrative facilities) that could
                              necessitate involuntary land acquisition resulting in involuntary resettlement of people and/or loss
                              of access to natural resources and involuntary restriction of access to parks and protected areas.

                                                                        Page 7 of 11
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           The physical interventions of ANRLMP will result from proposed rehabilitation of access roads,

                           irrigation infrastructures, storage facilities, water storage infrastructures, irrigations schemes. The
                           likely environmental and social impacts could include: soil erosion and degradation, decreased
                           water quality, loss of vegetation, fauna disturbance, deposition of solid wastes, dust emission,
                           social impacts related with loss of land, resource use conflict, impacts on vulnerable and
                           marginalized groups, health and safety of construction workers/artisans.

                           The ESMF already includes a list of potential impacts and mitigation measures to be implemented
                           for infrastructure & construction works, such as storage facilities, water storage infrastructures,
                           small and medium irrigation schemes to be reviewed during the subprojects conception in order to
                           include specific mitigation measures in planning and design phases to ensure environmental and
                           social sound designs, as well as during construction and operation phases to avoid or minimize to
                           the maximum possible any adverse impacts.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           All expected project impacts should be easily managed within the context of specific ESMPs to be
                           developed during Project implementation. However, it should be noted that MITADER has
                           recently created AQUA (Agencia de Controlo de Qualidade Ambiental) in order to strengthen the
                           Ministry's capacity to monitor and control any environmental, natural resources and land-related
                           impacts from projects licensed in Mozambique, separating licensing from inspection functions
                           within the Ministry. This represents another action that will contribute to avoiding or minimizing
                           any potential Project adverse impacts.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           MITADER has assigned the International Financing Management Unit (UGFI) to function as

                           Project Coordinating Unit. A dedicated Environmental and Social Safeguards Focal Point (ESSFP)
                           has been hired specifically for the Project and will also work collaboratively with the UT-REDD+,
                           which is also part of UGFI and has another dedicated ESSFP working under WB-financed
                           projects. The ESSFP hired for the Project will also work with UGFI's Monitoring & Evaluation
                           Specialist and Provincial project coordinators and their teams to ensure systematic compliance
                           with both Safeguards, Gender and Vulnerability guidelines, as well as with national environmental
                           regulations. It should be noted that the Government's Project's ESSFP is also tasked in her ToRs to
                           build the capacity of all Government staff relevant to the Project, including at Provincial and
                           District levels. Despite the fact that Borrower has long lasting, proven experience and expertise in
                           managing World Bank-funded operations, both in the agriculture and natural resources
                           management sectors, the World Bank Environmental Specialist will provide additional series of
                           environmental and social safeguards trainings to further strengthen Borrower capacity and
                           improve both the perception of safeguards policies, as well as gender and vulnerable groups
                           inclusion.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The ESMF, RPF and PMP included extensive and participatory public consultations which
                           ensured that all stakeholders' views and concerns, in particular of women, were considered in
                           project design and implementation mechanism. Key stakeholders include: smallholder and small
                           emerging commercial farmers; local leaders; District and Provincial Government institutions;
