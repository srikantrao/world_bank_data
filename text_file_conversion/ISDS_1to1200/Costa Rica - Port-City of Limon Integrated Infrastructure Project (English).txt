B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The long-term purpose is to collaborate in the transformation of the Port-City of Limon into a regional 
center of economic growth, thus helping to improve the country’s overall competitiveness and to alleviate 
the city’s poverty rate and social inequalities. Achieving this would require working both at the national 
and local level, developing soft skills and capacities, carrying out reforms and upgrading the quality of 
infrastructure facilities and services locally. This is an ambitious agenda, which can not be fulfilled within 
the term of a typical investment project. Under that perspective, the project is conceived as a first step 
towards that direction, with development objectives less ambitious than the one stated before. 
Overall, the development objective of the project is to increase Costa Rica’s trade competitiveness by 
improving the port business environment, and improving living conditions within the city of Limon. 
 
Specifically, the project would seek to:  
 
i. 
Improve the port’s business environment and build consensus regarding subsequent and more 
complex reforms needed to ensure long-term sustainability; 
ii. 
Revitalize the urban environment in the conurbation of Limon; and 
iii. 
Leverage the interface and synergies between the port and the city. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
3.  Preliminary project description  
 
Page  2
 
 
During the identification mission (August 2003) for the project, the following components were proposed. 
The team based its recommendations on a preliminary analysis of the port of Limon/Moín’s performance, 
the city’s situation and its synergies with the port, as well as field trips to the area and participatory 
diagnostics with sectoral authorities. Future feasibility studies and consultations with stakeholders and 
community groups will help address the pertinence and viability of these proposed interventions.  
 
Component 1- Developing Facilities to Support Port Activities
: 
 
Under this component, the project will focus on developing facilities that even though are not located in 
the port itself, are aimed at improving the port business environment, thus encouraging an increase in port 
activities. Specifically, the project will contribute to the creation of a Logistic Activity Zone
1
2
, developing 
new operational facilities such as distribution services, storage and packaging. The Government will 
upgrade and prepare the basic infrastructure required, which will be given to a concessionaire for its 
development. According to informal interviews with potential users (port users), there is a demand for 
this kind of services, which JADPEVA is not currently offering. Another sub-component requested by the 
GoCR was the rehabilitation of some road access to the port (mainly one bridge that was destroyed during 
the 1991 earthquake, and was replaced by a 
temporarily
 metallic structure that is being used up to date).  
 
Finally, this component will include resources to finance technical assistances aimed at strengthening the 
port sector in general, and the Limon/Moín port in particular. This sub-component will be designed to 
also provide support in the consensus building required for the subsequent and more complex reforms in 
Limon/Moín. Specific activities will be identified and agreed with the GoCR during project preparation.  
 
Component 2 – Port-City Strategic and Physical Planning
: 
 
This component will finance the formulation of a tactical development strategy for the Port-City of 
Limon. It will include participatory workshops and other work that would help to form and reinforce a 
shared long-term vision, as well as a short term strategy, for the Port-City. This phase will also include 
updating the Master Plan for the port and incorporating its linkages with the development of the city.  
 
Through these planning efforts, the parties will identify investment priorities, which they will 
subsequently incorporate into a capital investment plan for the city. They will try to link formulation of 
this plan with budgetary planning processes at the local level, so as to include budgeting for recurrent cost 
obligations implied in the identified capital investments. 
 
Component 3 – Urban Revitalization
: 
 
Based on the Master Plan described in the previous paragraph, this component will address the 
rehabilitation and/or expansion of urban services, including water supply, storm drainage, sewerage 
and/or solid waste management systems, as well as recreational facilities and other violence mitigating 
infrastructure (such as street lighting, recreational areas or community telecenters). Even though the 
Master Plan will include all those services, specific targets to be financed under the loan will be decided 
during project preparation. In addition, the team also proposed to structure a sub-component aimed at 
building capacity for municipal financial management and revenue generation as well as for urban 
services management, particularly solid waste management, roads and storm drainage, street addressing, 
and violence prevention and disaster mitigation.

 A Logistic Activities Zone is defined as an industrial or economic-related activities area dedicated to the logistics of marit
ime merchandise. The 
concept was born in European ports during the 70s (Germany and Pays-Bas). 
 
2
 This Logistic Activity Zone (ZAL in Spanish- 
Zona de Actividades Logisticas
) will be developed nearby the port, using land that already belong 
to either JAPDEVA or RECOPE. It is envisaged that around 10 Ha will be used for the development of this ZAL.

This component will also address creating local economic development and capacity building in tourist 
services among local businesses and community organizations. The establishment of neighborhood 
community telecenters with the dual purpose of involving youth and promoting local economic 
development also will be taken into account. 
 
Finally, the team envisages to have a sub-component regarding address-based GIS (geographic 
information system). Its objective is to establish a multi-purpose street addressing system for cost-
recovery purposes of urban services, and municipal revenue generation, as well as for the tracking, 
monitoring and evaluation of the project components. The sub component requires the corresponding 
capacity development at the municipal level.
