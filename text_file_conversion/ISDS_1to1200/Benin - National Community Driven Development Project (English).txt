A.2. Project Objectives 
 
Project development objective
.
The project’s main development objective is to test, through a 
learning-by-doing approach, the implementation of Community-Driven Development (CDD) 
activities by line ministries, local governments and local communities to improve the access of 
the poorest communities in Benin to basic social and economic services; so that the line 
ministries and local governments will be ready for further CDD implementation through 
programmatic and integrated support. 
 
Specific objectives
 of the project are: (i) to develop a national CDD policy that harmoniously 
completes the communal decentralization policy and the ongoing sector decentralization policy; 
(ii) to build capacity of stakeholders to implement CDD; (iii) to support funding of sub-projects 
under communal development plans established in response to the demand from communities 
targeted by the project, and implemented by the communes or communities according to their 
respective comparative advantage in order to improve access of poor populations to basic 
infrastructures, social services, economic opportunities and micro-finance services; (iv) to help 
targeted communities access microfinance services, and (v) to strengthen the capacities of central 
and decentralized services of the government, the communes and communities to enable them to 
Page  2
plan, implement, use and efficiently maintain the above mentioned investments.

and communities have and microfinance institutions, in average, have been 
timely answered by the SE-PNDCC according to the time-schedule of the 
Implementation Manual;. 
 
The PNDCC will contribute to the following higher level objectives: (i) Millennium Development 
Goals 
(MDGs) 
–
provision of improved basic infrastructure by the new project, focused on the 
poorest communities will help achieving several of the MDGs 
inter alia
 in education, health, 
water and sanitation, gender equity; (ii)
 local development 
–
the project will empower 
communities by enabling them to have the authority to use resources to improve their living 
conditions, and building their capacities to do so; (iii)
 decentralization to local governments - 
the 
project will build the capacity of local governments to integrate CDD in the development and 
implementation of their local development plans, and to learn that empowering their communities 
is mutually benefiting; (iv) 
realignment of the role of line ministries
 (such as education, health, 
water and sanitation, agriculture, livestock and fisheries) at the central and local levels to 
integrate by integrating CDD in the devolution of former responsibilities to local governments, 
concomitant with community empowerment and increased use of private sector services; 
(v) 
strengthening good governance and accountability
 by increasing demand for it through 
improved transparency, and capacity building in procurement and fiduciary management at the 
grassroots community and the local government level; and (vi) shifting from the “project” to 
“programmatic” approach by testing the use of the regular Government financial channels with 
Government Financing in parallel to IDA financing.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1. Strengthening the capacity of the ministries, communes, and communities to 
implement the Community-Driven Development. 
 
The main objective of this component is to build capacity with three key partners to implement 
the national CDD policy:  ministries at the central and local levels, communes, and grassroots 
community organizations. It is organized along the following four sub-components: 
1.1. 
Strengthening the institutional capacity of the public sector at the central and local levels 
to develop and implement CDD strategy, policy, and programs
.
This sub-component will: (i) 
assist the government to develop the legal and administrative framework for the implementation 
of a national CDD policy; and (ii) build the line ministry’s capacity to realign their roles 
according to both decentralization and CDD;    
Page  4
1.2. 
Strengthening the capacities of communes to implement CDD, at the level of communes 
and villages
.
This subcomponent will build participating local governments’ institutional capacity 
to integrate CDD into: (i) their local planning and (ii) the implementation mechanism of 
subprojects by the local government or the communities according to the subsidiarity principle – 
i.e. depending on their comparative advantage;  
1.3. 
Strengthening the capacity of grassroots communities to plan and implement village and 
neighborhood sub-projects within their Communal Development Plans
.
This subcomponent will 
build the communities’ capacity to initiate, develop, implement and monitor sub-projects, by 
providing: (i) Grassroots Management Training on key skills such as: village governance, 
participatory poverty assessment and needs assessment, community-based financial and 
procurement management, and participatory monitoring; and (ii) assistance from facilitators, such 
as Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), during the capacity-building process; 
1.4. 
Strengthening the capacity of all stakeholders at all levels to provide analysis, 
monitoring-evaluation and communication on the national CDD program and the 
PNDCC.
 This subcomponent will support: (i) the installation and functioning of an 
efficient M&E system to allow the national partners to make balanced management and 
strategic decisions at all levels; and to establish a communication system ensuring 
transparency of the program for improved accountability of partners. 
 
Component 2. Improving access by the poor to basic services and infrastructure.  
 
The objective of this component is two fold: first, 
to practice CDD,
 by
allowing communes to 
delegate to communities the execution of tasks for which the latter have a comparative advantage, 
and therefore to learn that CDD is mutually beneficial; thus the CDD approach will improve 
service delivery to communities that are the constituency of the elected authorities; second, 
to test 
the use of Government Financing 
for practicing this CDD approach. This component is organized 
into the following two sub-components:  
 
2.1. 
Improving access of the poor to basic services and infrastructures through multi-villages 
sub-projects implemented by communes
.
This subcomponent will provide grants to the communes 
for the implementation of communal subprojects of multi-village interest, initiated by the 
participating communes through their local planning, developed according to norms and 
specifications of the concerned sector, and implemented by the communes; 
 
2.2.  
improving access of the poor basic services and infrastructures through single-villages 
or 
–neighborhood subprojects implemented by local communities
.
This subcomponent will 
provide grants to communities for the implementation of small-scale subprojects of single-village 
interest, participatorily initiated and prepared by the targeted communities on the basis of their 
priorities, approved by the communes in the framework of their Communal Development Plans 
on the basis of criteria including the respect of the concern
ed sector’s norms, financed by the 
communes and implemented by the communities, including financial and procurement 
management.  
 
Component 3. Improving access by the poor to financial services for income-generating 
activities 
 
The objective of this compon
ent is to facilitate sustainable access to financial services, 
Page  5
particularly to microfinance (savings, loans, and microinsurance) by targeted poor populations.  
The component is organized in two subcomponents as follows: 
 
3.1.  
Strengthening MFIs’ capacity to supply microfinance products and services that fit the 
needs of targeted Communities for the financing of IGAs.
 
This subcomponent will reinforce the 
capacities of existing MFIs to enable them to reach the project’s target populations who are 
seeking access to financial services including loans to finance IGAs. It will provide grants to 
MFIs which have proposed acceptable plans for the development of new financial products 
and/or services that better suit the needs of the targeted poor communities.   
3.2
 
Advisory Services for the funding and management of IGAs.
 
The objective of this sub-
component is two-fold: (i) improving the capacity of the targeted communities to improve their 
knowledge about their economic activities (mainly agriculture) and to design/improve and 
manage IGAs that can be financed by MFIs; (ii) testing a CDD approach to deliver rural 
development (such as agricultural) services that provides actual experience to line ministries for 
economic development (such as the Ministry of Agriculture - MAEP), that can be used for the 
realignment of their way to do business under the Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC). The 
subcomponent will provide grants to communities to finance the advisory services on the basis of 
their needs and requests.
 
Component 4. Support for the management of Community-driven development. 
The objective of this component is to support the implementing agency with special focus on: (i) 
the transition towards a programmatic approach; and (ii) the implementation of future sub-
projects in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner. 
4.1. 
Support to the Executive Secretariat of the National Committee for  Community Driven 
Development.
 
The objective of this component is to put in place the SE-PNDCC and to support 
its coordination/management mandate which is to: (i) act as the National Committee for 
Community Driven Development’s (CNDCC) Secretariat; (ii) coordinate the day-to-day 
operations for project implementation; (iii) manage IDA  funds and Government counterpart and 
support management of Government co-financing; and (iv) prepare the transition to 
programmatic support. 
 
4.2. 
Environmental Management
.
The objective of this sub-component is to provide (i) a 
mechanism which will enable the relevant project implementers to screen future sub-projects for 
potential environmental and social impacts and to carry out the appropriate level of 
environmental work; (ii) environmental training for members of the Project Executing Secretary 
including the Fiduciary Agency, the 
communes
,
the technical services and NGOs involved in the 
implementation of the proposed project, and representatives of the benefiting 
communautés
 
in 
such areas as environmental legislation, the roles and responsibilities of the 
communes
 in 
environmental manage
ment, and Benin’s environmental challenges; and (iii) an outline of the 
institutional arrangements under the proposed project that would allow for the effective 
implementation of sub-projects as well as the strengthening of environmental management 
capacity in the context of Benin’s ongoing decentralization process.
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
Location of the activities of the project cannot be known at the stage of project preparation, since 
sub-projects will be determined by communities during project implementation.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
In view of the anticipated sub-project activities, safeguard issues in relation to pest 
management, the management of water infrastructures (i.e. sub-projects involving the 
construction of small dams, other small-scale irrigation infrastructures, and water 
retention pools for livestock), soil and water pollution, soil erosion, loss of vegetation and 
land acquisition were identified. None of these impacts will be significant or irreversible.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Potential indirect and/or long-term impacts are not anticipated as a result of project 
activities. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Given the objectives of this project discussed earlier, alternatives to this approach were 
discussed and were found not to be acceptable. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  8
The Borrower has prepared (i) an Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) which includes guidance for integrated pest management and efficient 
management of water infrastructures, including small dams at the sub-project level; and 
(ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to address potential issues that might arise 
due to the need for land acquisition. Capacity to implement the measures proposed in 
these documents exists, however, as the ESMF indicated, the institutional responsibilities 
need to be clarified and environmental management capacity at several levels needs to be 
strengthened. The project provides the necessary support in this regard.  
 
The project has been successfully negotiated and the minutes were signed on July 9, 2004 
 
Page  9
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders include the communes, communautés, the Fiduciary Agency, technical 
ministries and NGOs. They were consulted during the preparation of the ESMF and RPF 
which reflect their inputs. Both documents have been disclosed in Benin (through NGOs, 
ministries, mayors’ offices) and at the Bank's Infoshop on January 26, 2004.
