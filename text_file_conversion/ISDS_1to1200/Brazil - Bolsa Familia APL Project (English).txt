A.2. Project Objectives 
As discussed elsewhere, the broad objectives of the BFP are to reduce poverty and inequality and 
promote human capital investments among poor families (including indigenous and quilombolo 
populations) through the provision of direct monetary transfers to poor families and incentives for 
investing in human capital.  As a Sector-Wide Approach, World Bank assistance would broadly 
support these same objectives.  Nonetheless, as the Bank’s financial contribution is relatively 
small (US$520.2 million, or about 8% of total conditional cash transfers under the BFP), it would 
be far-fetched to state the overall reduction of poverty as the 
direct
 objective of the Bank’s 
assistance under the proposed project.  Rather, the proposed project would seek to strengthen the 
BFP’s ability to achieve these broader objectives of reducing poverty and inequality and 
promoting human capital development by supporting: (a) a consolidation of conditional cash 
transfer programs and reductions in gaps and duplications in coverage; (b) a strengthening of the 
system for identifying the target population; (c) the development of a monitoring and evaluation 
system for the BFP; and (d) a strengthening of the basic institutional functioning of the program. 
The proposed project is at the center of one of the core pillars of the Bank’s CAS – achieving a 
more equitable Brazil – and is closely aligned with corporate priorities of achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals.  The BFP will directly contribute to the reduction of poverty 
(MDG 1) and inequality in the short- and long-term.  In coordination with other government 
programs, many of which are Bank supported, it will also contribute to reducing malnutrition

 The total World Bank loan is US$520.2 million.  This includes US$500 million (Component 1) that 
would be reimbursed to the the Treasury against a small share (less than 10%) of expenditures on 
conditional cash transfers under the BFP during the project period.  Conditional cash transfers under the 
BFP are largely funded with government resources that are earmarked for that purpose.  As such, the World 
Bank loan would not represent additionality of financing for the BFP for this component.  The loan also 
includes US$15 million (Components 2-5) that will support technical assistance and project management.  
Finally, it includes US$5.2 million in a front end fee for the loan.

investments in education, nutrition and health (for pregnant women and young children).
 
A.3. Project Description 
The proposed first phase APL project (mid-2004 to end-2006) would consist of four components: 
one SWAp component that would support the implementation of the BFP, the consolidation of 
conditional cash transfers into the BFP, and reductions in duplications and gaps in coverage; and 
three mutually-reinforcing technical components to help improve the quality and basic 
architecture of the program.  The project would also support a small component for project 
management.  
Component 1: Conditional Cash Transfers (Grants) (US$500 million).
  This component 
would provide support to the government in consolidating and rationalizing conditional cash 
transfers, and in reducing duplications and gaps in coverage of the BFP, as part of a broader and 
balanced strategy for economic and human capital development.  For this component only, the 
World Bank would reimburse the Treasury a share of the expenses on conditional cash transfers 
made under the BFP during the project period.  The category of financing would be cash transfers 
(grants).  Disbursement percentages would increase as key technical improvements 
(“milestones”) are made.   
Component 2: Strengthening the System for Identifying the Target Population (US$3.8 
million).
  This component would provide assistance to improve the mechanisms used to identify 
the target population of the BFP, which constitute a key element of the basic architecture of the 
program.  With improved targeting, the program will achieve better redistributive efficiency, with 
a higher share of its resources going to the poor, and will be able to cover a larger share of the 
poor.  It will thus serve as a more efficient instrument for reducing poverty and inequality in 
Brazil.   
As with its predecessors (pre-reform programs), the BFP selects beneficiaries from a national 
database of potentially poor households called the “Cadastro Único.”  While the construction of 
the Cadastro Único sought to integrate household registries across the (previous) multiple 
programs in a very short period of time, there are several aspects of the system that could be 
improved.  To do this, Component 2 of the proposed project will support activities to strengthen 
the targeting of the BFP and overhaul the Cadastro Único system in several key areas: (a) 
clarifying the strategic framework for the overall system; (b) revising eligibility criteria for the 
BFP with consideration of the specificity of the indigenous and quilombolo communities and 
developing a new Cadastro questionnaire accordingly; (c) revising the data collection strategy for 
the Cadastro Único; (d) 
reducing administrative errors in the Cadastro Único; and 
(e) strengthening the technical and technological capacity of the Cadastro Unit in BFP/MDS to 
monitor, verify and use the Cadastro Único, as well as the capacity of municipalities, 
communities and other potential partner institutions such as FUNAI/FUNASA (for the 
indigenous) and the Fundação Palmares/SEPPIR (for the quilombolas) for carrying out data 
collection and beneficiary selection. 
 
Component 3: Developing a Monitoring and Evaluation System (US$6.2 million).
  This 
component  would support the design and implementation of a solid monitoring and evaluation 
(M&E) system.  Such a system would constitute a key element of the basic architecture of the 
program, and one that the government has made a top priority since the launching of the BFP.  To 
support this, Component 3 of the proposed project will support: (a) the development of the 
concept for the overall M&E system and support for capacity building in BFP/MDS in this area;

 which would 
Page  4
 
 
provide up-to-date information on program activities and outputs; (c) the development of 
instruments to monitor program processes to provide feedback on the quality of service delivery 
and program implementation and to detect problems so that they can be corrected early (including 
quality control reviews to monitor BFP processes, mechanisms to monitor inter-governmental 
partnerships, and support for citizen oversight (“social control”) mechanisms including in 
indigenous and quilombola communities); and (d) the use and development of qualitative 
instruments and quantitative surveys to monitor and evaluate key outcomes and the impact of the 
program at both the “territorial” (municipal, sub-municipal including in indigenous and 
quilombola communities) and family levels.   
Component 4: Institutional Strengthening (US$4.4 million).
  This component would support 
the strengthening of the basic institutional functioning of the BFP in terms of: (a) strengthening of 
the operational institutional framework, including the legal architecture of the program; (b) 
strengthening program management; (c) developing a solid communications and dissemination 
strategy, including ensuring that it reaches indigenous and quilombola peoples; and (d) evaluating 
and piloting innovations in “emancipation” and “bridging” approaches and service delivery.   
Component 5: Project Management (US$0.6 million).  
The project will not create a separate 
unit for project management.  Rather, it will provide such support to existing institutional 
structures as well as to a “Nucleo Gestor” that would oversee the project (made up of staff in 
MDS).  To provide such support, the proposed project will finance incremental costs related to 
management and supervision of Project activities.  These costs include a committee of external 
consultants that would help advise on overall project activities and strategy, consultants on each 
of the three technical components, consultants for the fiduciary and operational aspects 
(procurement, financial management, project planning and supervision), office equipment, and 
travel expenses.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project trigger’s the Bank’s Indigenous Peoples Policy (OD 4.20), which requires an IPDP to 
ensure that indigenous and quilombola peoples participate in and benefit from the project in a 
culturally appropriate way.  The proposed project will make efforts to (a) ensure that household 
registry activities (which form the basis of beneficiary selection) are carried out in indigenous 
areas and 
quilombolas
 in a culturally appropriate way so that indigenous peoples and afro-
descendents have equal access to the program; and (b) monitor the participation and receipt of 
benefits by such populations.   
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area. 
 
Reduction of poverty and inequality and promotion of human capital investments among the poor 
in Brazil, including indigenous and quilombola populations.  
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
n.a. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The full IPDP was presented and discussed with the government (which also participated in 
consultations), which agreed to consider the recommendations while fine-tuning the Bolsa 
Família Program.   Additionally, Government officials also met with representatives of 
indigenous and quilombola peoples to discuss these recommendations and it was agreed that this 
dialogue would continue during the BFP implementation.  Finally, in the context of the technical 
assistance components of the proposed loan (US$15 million), the following recommendations 
will be incorporated into the proposed project: 
• 
Ensure that the updating of the 
Cadastro Único
 will consider cultural differences, 
including in the selection of indicators that will be used to determine beneficiary 
eligibility.    
• 
Train agents responsible for registering indigenous and quilombola families so as to 
ensure cultural sensitivity and knowledge in the process. 
• 
Ensure proper dissemination of BFP information, including eligibility criteria, operations, 
and conditionality, specifically tailored to indigenous and quilombola publics; 
• 
Continuously  monitor and evaluate the BFP to ensure that indigenous and quilombola 
communities have access and benefit from the program in a culturally appropriate manner 
and the that program does not have unexpected negative effects on the community;  
• 
Provide technical assistance to the Government so that it develops a strategy to ensure 
that payments are accessible to groups living in reach remote areas, including indigenous 
and quilombola communities; and 
• 
Establish a monitoring mechanism that includes representation from  indigenous and 
quilombola peoples. 
The BFP is managed by 
the Secretaria de Renda de Cidadania
  (SRC) in the Ministry of Social 
Development.  In addition, institutional arrangements for various functions of the program also 
involve a number of other actors, among which collaboration with FUNAI for registering 
indigenous households and monitoring the program in indigenous areas.

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Two consultation workshops were held in preparation of this project.  The first one included a 
group of anthropologists specialized in indigenous and quilombola communities and the second 
one included consultations with representatives of indigenous and quilombola populations.  
During the consultations with representatives of indigenous and quilombola peoples, Government 
officials presented the BFP and discussed different aspects of the program that could be of impact 
to these groups.  Furthermore, there were extensive discussions between Government officials 
and these groups, which presented their concerns about the program as currently presented and 
made recommendations on how to improve it.   The project’s IPDP was prepared with inputs 
from both events and reflect the recommendations made by participants in the consultations.  
During both meetings it was agreed that the final version of the IPDP would be disclosed to the 
participants of both events once the document was reviewed and cleared by the QAT.
