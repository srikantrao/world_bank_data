B. Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN]

The proposed program aims at increasing the access of the poor to housing services through transparent
mechanisms and financial operators. Specifically, the Project would (a) increase access to housing
finance/authorized housing for households with incomes below 5MW, (b) increase competition and
private sector involvement in the financing of social housing, (c) improve the accountability and
sustainability of the subsidy system (in terms of eligibility criteria, the required contribution by
beneficiary households, alternative ways to deal with credit risk, which is the major hurdle to expand
lending to lower income households and improved monitoring; and (d) experiment with instruments to
help local governments expand urban services and serviced land.

It is expected that during phase 1 of the program (2004-2005) the program would have: (a) provided
subsidies to benefit X number of households; (b) encouraged at least xx private sector institutions to
participate in the financing of low income housing programs; (c) involved at least XXX non-profit entities
participating as project sponsors (lenders and/or implementing agencies) over X years (in addition to the
typical public sector sponsors of municipalities and states); and (d) improved monitoring and evaluation
system to track targeting and outcomes. Phase 2 would consolidate and expand the above objectives and
would experiment with alternative ways of helping municipalities to enhance low income housing
program through a pilot block grant subsidy program;

C. Project Description [from section 4 of PCN]
The proposed first phase APL project (2004-2005) would consist of four components, including co-
financing the conditional cash transfers (SWAp component) and three technical components to help
improve the basic architecture of the program and the integration of CCT programs.

Component 1: Conditional Cash Transfers (Grants) ($150 million). This component would cofinance
the direct subsidy program via a Sector Wide Approach (SWAPs). The project would disburse against
cash transfers (grants) to poor families that are eligible to receive the complementary subsidy and to the
financial institution who won the bid to implement the program for a certain number of subsidies

Component 2: Project monitoring and evaluation (US$3.0 million) . This component would finance
the development of an improved mechanism for selecting beneficiaries, for monitoring compliance of all
parties (banking, housing construction and municipalities) with existing regulations for housing
construction and land management.

Component 3: Project Management and strategy development ($3 million). for a sustainable and
consistent fiscal approach to the development of social housing subsidy programs (including PSH, and
FGTS) with an estimated cost of US$3.0 million over the four year period.

D. Project location (if known)
National.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
The PSH is being managed by the Secretariat of Treasury in the Ministry of Finance and the Secretariat of
Housing Development in the Ministry of Cities. The project will seek to strengthen their institutional
capacities specifically for improved targeting (beneficiary selection) and monitoring and evaluation
(M&E). It is unlikely that the project ­ which supports cash transfers to poor families through financial
institutions who are read to finance their housing purchase ­ will trigger any safeguard policies in any
significant way.
