B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The second phase (APL2) will build on the accomplishments, processes and lessons of 
APL1 by seeking to improve local environmental quality and governance through: a) 
consolidating reforms for solid waste management; b) financing locally-prioritized 
environmental investments in the areas of solid waste and water resource management; c) 
reducing waste-related greenhouse gas emissions; and d) strengthening the framework for local 
environmental planning and management, including public information and participation.  Much 
of this can be done based on work being completed in APL1. 
 
If the project is successful, the principal outcomes for the target group (the residents of 
Western Java, especially poorer communities) would include: 
 
¨
Reduced environmental impact from improper solid waste disposal and poor water 
resource management 
¨
Fewer socio-environmental conflicts arising from waste disposal 
¨
Lower health and economic impacts from priority local environmental problems such 
as flooding 
Page  2
¨
Reduced impact of consumption patterns on global warming (fewer tons of CO2-
equivalent emissions per capita) 
¨
More effective environmental management at the local level through planning and 
greater public involvement 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The CPSU identified three design options that would build on the results of APL1 and 
help achieve the specified objectives: 
 
BASIC OPTION
 
–
this consists of support for the organization and operations of the 
Jabodetabek Waste Management Corporation, the Greater Bandung Waste Management 
Corporation and greenhouse gas reduction efforts (both composting credits program and 
opportunities for landfill gas control); institutionalization of the provincial and local 
environmental strategies and “state-of-the-environment” reporting; and expansion of the 
Community Environment Facility, both in terms of geographical coverage and number of 
sub-projects. 
 
OPTION TWO
 –
the Basic Option plus financing of eight local government sub-projects 
that have emerged from the provincial and local environmental strategies (examples 
include a new landfill in Serang, watershed management in West Java province and lake 
management in Depok) plus financing of drainage works in the Bopunjur basin that were 
identified in APL1. 
 
OPTION THREE
 –
Option Two plus financing of follow-up investments for medical 
waste management and emergency preparedness 
 
Following discussions between the EASUR sector manager and the project’s technical 
team, there is growing consensus for a version of the second option.  Preliminarily, the project 
would consist of two thematic components: 
solid waste management
 and 
flood 
control/drainage
.
The SWM component would encompass: institutionalization of the 
metropolitan waste management corporations, expansion of composting credits, promotion of 
landfill gas recovery, medical waste management, and financing of waste-related investments at 
the local level.  The water component would include: drainage and flood control investments in 
the Bopunjur basin as well as in DKI Jakarta, and water management projects at the local and 
provincial level.  A capacity-building and institutional development component would support 
community environmental management initiatives, institutionalization of the provincial and local 
environmental strategies and “state-of-the-environment” reporting, and project management as 
well as monitoring. 
 
The PAD anticipates a loan/credit of $49.3 million for APL2, up to $7.5 million of GEF 
resources and a counterpart of $16.2 million.  However, the client may pursue a larger loan 
depending on the financing needs identified during preparation.  The blend of IDA and IBRD 
resources will need to be determined at the time of negotiations, reflecting Indonesia’s eligibility 
for IDA at the time.  A PHRD grant of $755,670 has been secured to assist the borrower with 
project preparation.

Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01) 
While the project is environmental in 
nature, it could raise environmental issues such as the need to control leachates 
from new and rehabilitated landfill sites, proper handling and disposal of medical 
wastes, safety at drainage works, etc.  For these reasons, the project is 
preliminarily being listed as a Category B, requiring an environmental audit and, 
if necessary, preparation of an environmental management plan.

Involuntary Resettlement
(
OP
/
BP
4.12) 
The siting of new landfills, done in 
cooperation with local communities, may require some mutually acceptable 
resettlement.  Similarly, priority drainage works may require resettling at-risk 
dwellers to remove them from flood-prone areas.  A resettlement action plan will 
be prepared to guarantee that any necessary resettlement takes place according to 
World Bank guidelines.

Forests
(
OP
/
BP
4.36) 
There is a more remote chance that a local or provincial 
water management project could involve improved watershed management.  
Problematic watersheds are usually areas with degraded forests so the project 
might finance forest rehabilitation.  While this is not normally a problem, any 
such activities will be designed to be in compliance with the World Bank’s forest 
policy.
