B.  Project Objectives  
 
Higher education in Nepal is being offered by five universities under the Ministry of Education and 
Sports, and two autonomous institutions under the Ministry of Health. Tribhuvan University (TU) 
accounts for over 90% of tertiary enrolment of around 135 thousands. It comprises 60 government-funded 
campuses, known as constituent campuses, accounting for about 55% of the total TU enrolment, and 
privately-funded campuses, of which 103 are community (also called public) campuses and 69 private 
campuses. Universities other than TU also comprise constituent and privately funded campuses 
–
predominantly private campuses. If constituent campuses of TU and Mahendra Sanskrit University 
(MSU) are funded primarily through government grants, the constituent campuses of remaining three – 
Kathmandu University (KU), Purbaanchal University (PURU) and Pokhara University (POKU) – are 
funded primarily through student fees. The key challenges of the first category of campuses are financial 
sustainability and efficiency, where as that of the second category are access to meritorious needy 
students. The challenges common to all types of campuses but to a varying degree are poor access to 
meritorious needy students, inadequate quality of education, poor research, and inadequate transparency 
and accountability. As addressing all above challenges across the system is neither possible within the 
framework of this project nor feasible politically, the project aims at supporting reforms at selected 
academic institutions that voluntarily commit to reforms. 
 
The project development objectives are: (a) to improve financial sustainability, competitiveness, and 
external and internal efficiency of  selected higher education institutions willing to reform; and (b) to 
ensure more equitable access to higher education.  A sample of indicators for assessing financial 
sustainability and competitiveness would be: the scale of the funding gap, participation in quality 
Page  2
assurance and accreditation process, number of applicants per student place, number of publications in 
refereed journals, employment rate of graduates and pass rates. The indicators for assessing performance 
of a particular institution would be established based on its strategic plan.  
 
C.  Project Description  
 
The purpose of the proposed intervention is not establishment of new faculties or enrolment expansion in 
the public sector but reforming the existing institutions. The proposed operation favors selection of 
institutions based on their commitment to reforms and funding them on a block grant basis so that 
institutions are able to spend resources according to their priorities. The commitment of institutions to 
reform will be judged on the basis of their acceptance of autonomy with formula-based funding. 
Autonomy for institutions will entail opportunities, if they perform better and risks if they do not. This 
incentive framework will be a driving force for improvement in autonomous institutions. Autonomy, in 
this project, is being conceived as a tool for shifting accountability of a given institution from that to a 
higher level institution to beneficiaries, and as such is expected to contribute to improvement in 
governance of the institution. 
 
D.  Project location 
 
The campuses participating in the project will be selected based on their acceptance of reforms, 
and the participating schools on a competitive basis based on their performance. Although this is 
a
country-wide project, the location of each participating campuses will not be specifically 
known until implementation of the project begins. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
The Ministry of Education and Sports has developed a some institutional capacity for safeguard 
policies through implementation of a series of IDA projects. The University Grants Commission 
(UGC) does not have prior experience of IDA projects. The UGC will draw on the safeguard 
policy capacity from TU, one of the participating universities.

Low to moderate potential environmental impacts may result from the 
rehabilitation and/or upgrading of physical facilities, possible in two components 
of the project: (a) grants for reforming institutions 
–
potentially covering four 
universities and their constituent campuses including community campuses; and 
(b) upgrading of high schools to higher secondary schools. The two other 
components of the project: (i) financial assistance to students; and, (ii) 
strengthening systemic capacity do not result in perceptible environmental 
impacts.

The project is classified as environment category B, as the project funds may be used for 
rehabilitation and/or upgrading of existing schools and campuses.  
 
III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN  
 
Most of the construction-related environmental impacts in the project could be mitigated and 
managed by implementing the “National Environmental Guidelines for School Improvement and 
Facility Management in Nepal” (NEGS), prepared for the Education for All Project, (which 
became effective in August 2004). For other health, hygiene, safety and effluent discharges, a 
brief environmental assessment will be undertaken for a representative sample of universities, 
constituent campuses, and a few high schools. Based on this assessment, the NEGS would be 
augmented to reflect the environmental mitigation, management and enhancement measures 
required for higher education facilities. Draft of the augmented NEGS would be ready and 
publicly disclosed prior to appraisal of the project.
