                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           To help the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics with: the re-basing of the CPI; improving sampling for the
                           HIES, Population and Agricultural Censuses; the implementation of the HIES/PSLM; and the
                           implementation of CAPI to collect price data.
                           C. Project Description
                           This project's main objective is to provide support to PBS to: rebase the CPI; improve sampling for
                           HIES/PSLM as well as the Population and Agricultural Censuses, and pilot CAPI for the collection
                           of price data for the CPI. This will entail developing custom software solutions, as well as providing
                           additional equipment to support interviewers, as well as technical support with software and
                           hardware issues that may arise. The PBS has indicated that they would like to pursue on open source
                           solution based on Open Data Kit (ODK). The TF will fund international consultants who are experts
                           in CPI rebasing and sampling ($60k) and support the development of software based on ODK that
                           can promote the use of CAPI ($20k), the implementation of price pilot ($32k) as well as additional
                           funds to procure tablets ($28k), and ongoing technical support ($20k). The outputs will be new
                           samples for the surveys and censuses; the rebased CPI, custom CAPI software, and a price pilot
                           using CAPI.
