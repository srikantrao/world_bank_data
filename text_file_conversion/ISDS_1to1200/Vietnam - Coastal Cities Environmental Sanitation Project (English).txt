B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The project development objectives are sustained improvements in environmental conditions in 
the project towns. This will lead to a better quality of life, particularly for the urban poor who 
currently live in squalid unsanitary conditions, which expose them to disease.  
 
The outcome of the project will be improved environmental conditions, measured by fewer 
incidences of flooding, less solid waste on the streets, improved quality of receiving waters, and 
safe disposal of solid waste. This will support the growth agenda through increased tourist 
activity, greater attractiveness to investors, enhanced property values and hence higher City 
GDPs. From a social and health perspective there will be a reduction in the incidence of water 
borne and water transmitted diseases. Finally, the URENCOs will be expected to recover all 
costs of operation, maintenance and the depreciation of equipment by the end of the project 
period and thus ensure sustainability of the outcomes. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
Page  2
The project will focus on the coastal cities of Nha Trang (population 270,000), Quy Nonh (Pop 
230,000) and Dong Hoi (Pop 95,000). These cities were selected because: they are experiencing 
higher than average growth, much of which is related to tourism, which depends on good 
environmental conditions; their water supplies have recently been, or are in the process of being, 
expanded; and they have high poverty densities. They represent the next tier of cities in Vietnam 
to tackle environmental sanitation issues. All the larger cities in the country are already 
undertaking sanitation investments. Each of the cities already has an existing urban Master Plan 
and the project will take these documents into account. 
 
Drainage/Sewerage
:
Existing drainage/sewerage infrastructure in the cities is limited and 
generally “combined” (storm water and wastewater discharge to the same sewer/drain).Flooding 
occurs frequently in the wet season and in Nha Trang resulting damage is estimated to cost up to 
VND 15 billion per year.  The project will include expansion of the networks, provision of 
additional hydraulic capacity, and the diversion of wastewater at storm overflow chambers 
located close to discharge points. Diverted wastewater will be collected in interceptor sewers 
which will discharge via pumping stations to a wastewater treatment plant, or plants. A 
significant part of the health benefits from improved sanitation derive from software 
interventions. The team will therefore consider complementary hygiene education programs 
within the project. 
 
Wastewater Treatment.
Most households rely on septic tanks for disposal of liquid wastes. These 
are effective to varying degrees and discharge to the ground or to surface drains. There is no off 
site wastewater treatment . In order to improve receiving water quality wastewater treatment will 
be provided. The project will assess the appropriate technology but there will be a trade-off 
between the desire for treatment which is simple to operate and maintain versus the need for 
compact solutions given the high land values in Quy Nhon and Nha Trang.  
 
Solid waste collection and disposal
.
Collection at the tertiary level will remain labor-intensive. 
The feasibility of contracting out collection and transfer of waste to the private sector will be 
carefully evaluated. For disposal, sanitary landfills incorporating leachate collection/treatment 
and gas collection (with either flaring, or possibly for power generation) will be adopted.  
 
Household sanitation.
Improvements to household sanitation are important to achieving 
reductions in environmental pollution. Revolving funds for household sanitation will be included 
to ensure that city residents, particularly the urban poor, derive a direct and tangible benefit from 
the project. This will be based on the highly successful experience of such funds in the Three 
Cities Sanitation Project. 
 
Strengthening of URENCOs.
Particular attention will be paid to strengthening URENCOs.  This 
will include an assessment of ways to enhance the autonomy, accountability and incentives of 
the providers. This will be partly institutional (drawing on studies underway in the anchor to look 
at well run public companies) and partly capacity building support to the companies e.g. in 
financial and commercial management.  
 
b) Lending will use the conventional project based SIL instrument.

c) The cities have domestic and international tourism as an increasingly important part of their 
economies (40% of economy in Nha Trang comes from tourism and services). Nha Trang, the 
largest of the cities, has recently received international recognition as having one of the world’s 
best beaches. It is also adjacent to marine protected areas with the highest coral diversity 
recorded in Vietnam (see project P067804 - Hon Mun Marine Project). It is an internationally 
recognized diving center. Sanitation infrastructure is in poor condition, and deteriorating, as a 
result of prolonged under-investment, rapid urbanization, expanding tourism, and increasing 
wastewater loads. Unless checked this will reverse the growth of tourism and thus reduce 
employment opportunities, particularly for the poor. 
 
d) No issues have been identified with regard to potential partners at this stage. SDC will support 
some project preparation activities, and may fund institutional strengthening activities, in Dong 
Hoi.  The task team will assess the potential to include a complementary GEF input, focusing on 
capacity building, especially modeling and monitoring of environmental quality. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project activities will take place in the cities of: 
·
Nha Trang  
·
Quy Nhon  
·
Dong Hoi  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Institutional capacity in the PPUs are weak. To mitigate this, experienced international 
consultants will be hired using grant funds to advise and assist local consultants during project 
preparation. For implementation, technical assistance will be included in the project to cover 
construction supervision and institutional strengthening.
