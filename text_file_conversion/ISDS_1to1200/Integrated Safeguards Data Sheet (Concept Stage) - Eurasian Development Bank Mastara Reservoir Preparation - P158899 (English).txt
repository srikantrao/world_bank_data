                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           To improve readiness of the Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Development-financed Mastara
                           Reservoir Project by supporting the relevant project preparation studies, and to enhance capacity of
                           the Water Sector Projects Implementation Unit to prepare and implement projects.
                           C. Project Description
                           At this stage, only very preliminary information exists concerning the Mastara Reservoir. Based on
                           an earlier feasibility study (from 1970), the command area of the proposed Mastara Reservoir is
                           located in one of the water-shortage areas in the Ararat Plain. Mastara will provide additional
                           supplies into the Armavir irrigation system. The proposed location is about 15 km from the town of
                           Armavir, near the Mastara railway station. The total capacity of the reservoir is expected to be
                           around 10.2 million m3, useful capacity - 8.2 million m3, the dam height will be around 30 m. The
                           area under the command of the Armavir canal is over 20,000 ha which includes supplies from the
                           Akhuryan Reservoir [commissioned in 1980]. Currently, additional water supplies to Armavir main
                           canal during the most critical irrigation months (July-August) is implemented through the Talin canal
                           from the Selav-Mastara River. The volume of supplementary supply varies between 1-2 m3/sec.
                           Downstream of this point, irrigation is supplied to the lands of 5 communities (Nairi, Myasnikyan,
                         Khanjyan, Lukashin and Norapat) for a total area of around 4,000 ha. About 8,000 Mm3 of water are
                         required for full water supply of these lands. After full development of lands under the command of
                         the 1st stage of the Talin canal up to the design level of 12,000 ha, flow availability during the

                         critical irrigation months (July-August) may be problematic. Thus, it becomes clear that construction
                         of a reservoir on the Selav-Mastara river for regulation may be beneficial. Construction of the
                         Mastara reservoir is expected to generate the following benefits:

                         �        Guaranteed quantity of irrigation water on the area of about 4,384 ha located within the
                         service areas of two existing water users associations (WUAs).
                         �        Decrease the use of groundwater in the Ararat Plain by about 5.3 Mm3 annually.
                         �        Reduce costs of irrigation water through the conversion from pump to gravity irrigation and
                         save annually about 2.1 million Kwhr (about USD 232,000) and associated operations and
                         maintenance (O&M) costs (about USD 65,000 annually).
                         �        Increase the agricultural production and the incomes of rural population: The main crops in
                         this area are orchards, vineyards, vegetables, wheat, and alfalfa. Improved irrigation will result in
                         higher yields/ higher share of cash crops.

                         As a result of the Mastara Reservoir, about 4,400 water users from six communities will benefit from
                         the project.

                         This project is financed through a recipient-executed grant from ECAPDEV. These funds, which are
                         administered and managed by the World Bank, have been selected for use in the preparation of the
                         Mastara Reservoir project (most likely to be financed by the Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and
                         Development) to ensure outputs that are of high quality and consistent with World Bank standards.
                         The grant will support the procurement of consultant services whose main tasks will be to prepare,
                         inter alia, a feasibility study for the reservoir, including preliminary designs, a draft procurement
                         plan, terms of reference for final designs, a draft monitoring and evaluation plan, preliminary
                         environment and social assessment documents (consistent with World Bank safeguard policies), and
                         the draft PAD. It is expected that the feasibility study will review various design solutions (which

                         review the quality of the hydrological data, identify irrigated lands and provide initial cost estimates
                         and a preliminary economic analysis. Finally, the grant will also be used to support the strengthening
                         of the operational capacity of WSPIU staff through relevant trainings. This will enhance the quality
                         of future project implementation.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The Mastara reservoir is to be built in the Armavir region, 15 km from the town of Armavir, near the
                         Mastara railway station. It will be located on the Selav-Mastara River and will be filled by this
                         river’s seasonal flow, glacier water from Mount Aragats, and storm water. The current estimated
                         total capacity of the reservoir will be around 10 million m3 with a dam height of about 30 m.

                         At this stage, precise resettlement and land acquisition requirements are unknown. The same is true
                         for the presence of natural habitats and historic/cultural heritage within the project area.
                         E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The WSPIU has a long history working with the World Bank on projects and as such, has a strong
                         working knowledge and experience with Bank safeguard policies and practices. As part of the
                         Mastara Reservoir Preparation project preparation, WSPIU will draft TORs for undertaking the
                           preliminary Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and preparing the Resettlement
                           Policy Framework (RPF), disclose these draft TORs and discuss them with stakeholders prior to
                           finalization. The ESIA report, including an Environmental and Social Management Plan, PRF, and
