I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
In recent years, the Government of Tanzania (GOT) has embarked on an ambitious reform agenda: public
service (PSRP), public finance (PFRP) and local government (LGRP). In addition, it has just defined, in
close collaboration with its development partners (DPs), comprehensive anti-corruption and legal sector
reform (LSRP) programs. This holistic strategic approach to improve its governance system is reflected in
"The National Framework on Good Governance" (GOT, December 1999). IDA would like to support
these efforts through a program that would complement the assistance presently provided for ongoing
reforms by other development partners and by IDA itself. The proposed operation is designed as a
comprehensive program that assumes the participation of several development partners (DPs). IDA is
already informed of overall donor interest in supporting all the program's components described in the
present document. IDA will work closely with these DPs to define how best to join forces to maximize the
benefits for Tanzania's good governance agenda.

The primary objective of the Accountability, Transparency and Integrity Program (ATIP) is to support the
implementation of Tanzania's strategic framework for good governance. ATIP aims at improving outcomes
and impacts of development programs on the poor by enhancing the quality of governance. This will be
done through: (i) strengthening the legal and judicial systems; (ii) enhancing public financial accountability;
(iii) strengthening oversight and watchdog institutions (OWIs), particularly, supporting the drive to combat
corruption; and (iv) improving coordination, management and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of
Government's programs aimed at enhancing transparency and integrity for greater accountability. The IDA
project would support these four components and would seek to complement other DPs' programs/projects
in these areas.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The Project will have four main components, as follows:

          (a) Strengthening legal and judicial system
          (b) Enhancing public financial accountability
          (c) Strengthening oversight and watchdog institutions

                                                        2
                                                                                                              ISDS


        (d) Program management and coordination

Strengthening legal and judicial system

The project will support select components or sub-components of the Government's medium term strategy
and action plan for the LSRP in collaboration with other DPs. Technical assistance, including
consultancies, training, computers and other office equipment and vehicles, and publishing and
disseminating materials contribute to achieving the following key outputs:

    1. an updated and modernized legal and regulatory framework;
    2. greater independence of the judiciary;
    3. strengthened management and coordination of legal sector institutions;
    4. enhanced competence, motivation and integrity of personnel;
    5. improved pre-service training of legal professionals;
    6. better access to justice for the poor and the disadvantaged; and
    7. improved work environment for legal and judicial officers.

In addition, the project will fund civil works/rehabilitation costs for select high priority structures in the
legal sector, possibly:

    1. Chambers for the Court of Appeal judges;
    2. The Law School; and
    3. Primary and districts magistrates courts.

Enhancing public financial accountability

The project will support activities leading to five key outputs contributing to greater financial
accountability:

    1. An effectively functioning transparent public procurement system. Major interventions to be
        supported in this area will include: drafting new laws, regulations, procedures and controls that
        will govern procurement by all public agencies; facilitating local training institutions to develop a
        curriculum and capacity to train a procurement cadre for the public service; and other capacity
        building measures to establish procurement units in MDAs and to contract out services.
    2. An effectively functioning internal audit system. Development of the internal audit function now
        considerably lags behind the milestone development that the country has made in other facets of
        public financial accountability. The project will support the design and implementation of a
        cost-effective internal audit system. Interventions will include consultancies, training, computers
        and other office equipment and vehicles. It is envisaged that work in this area would be done in
        close collaboration with SIDA.
    3. An OCAG that is independent for staffing and funding, and performs its functions with efficiency
        and effectiveness. Attaining the independence of the OCAG is already leveraged in the recently
        approved PSAC (?). The project will make available the assistance needed to improve the
        capacity of the office through training of staff in new and modern audit techniques (especially audit
        of computer systems and value for money audits), equipping the OCAG's offices in the districts,
        and procuring transport to facilitate travel to remote rural service delivery centers for audit.
    4. Enhanced standards and effectiveness of the accounting profession in the country. Under the
        just closed FILMUP (IDA Cr. No. 2413-TA), the Bank provided support for strengthening and
        consolidating the key institutions for development of the accounting profession in Tanzania. In

                                                        3
                                                                                                            ISDS


         particular, technical assistance, training and other capacity building measures, and investments in
         infrastructure were provided to accountancy and finance training institutes, and the National Board
         of Accountants and Auditors (NBAA) which has the statutory mandate to develop and regulate the
         accounting profession in the country. Still, the accounting profession needs to be further developed
         in Tanzania. Furthermore, preliminary findings of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of
         the FILMUP indicate the need for additional assistance, especially for the NBAA, to sustain the
         outcomes realized under that project. Studies carried out during FILMUP's extension also
         confirmed this need. The ATIP will make available this support to the NBAA and the accounting
         profession in general.
     5. Effective records management and information dissemination systems in MDAs. In the past
         four years, the GOT has piloted a program for improving records management in MDAs through
         two successive projects funded by DFID under the PSRP. However, the scope and coverage of
         this project have been limited to registry systems in some MDAs. Furthermore, while the
         evaluations of these DFID projects have clearly identified the need for a National Records and
         Archives Center in order to develop a sustainable public service records management system, the
         funds to build this center have not yet been available. The ATIP will provide: (i) on a
         demand-driven basis funds for the implementation of MDAs' strategies and action plans for
         development of their records management and information systems (this will be within the same
         strategic framework for improving the MDA's service delivery standards under the PSRP), and (ii)
         support to the construction and equipping of the National Records and Archives Center.

Strengthening oversight and watchdog institutions (OWIS)

This component aims at strengthening the demand side of the accountability equation. In this regard, at this
stage of project development, it is clear that technical assistance will be needed under the project to, as a
priority, rationalize the mandates, roles and functions of the plethora of public OWIs that have been
established over the years (see section B. 2.26).

It is, nonetheless, anticipated that among the public OWIs that will receive technical assistance to build
their capacity and improve their performance are:

         (i)      the Prevention of Corruption Bureau;
         (ii)     the relevant Committees of the Parliament (and Parliament?); and
         (iii)    the MDAs will also be supported to implement their anti-corruption and action plans on a
     demand-driven         basis, provided that the MDAs meet specific criteria.

The project will also provide technical assistance to develop and strengthen the operations of civil society
organizations that are active watchdogs on public accountability. The plan is to deliver this support on a
demand-driven basis. In this context IDA would integrate in its approach lessons learned from others
presently involved in supporting IEC for civil society, e.g., the Netherlands, UNDP, EU and others.

Program Management and Coordination

This component has three sub-components:

l First, strengthening program management and coordination. The project will provide the technical
     assistance and means needed to ensure that the "Accountability, Transparency and Integrity"
     coordination unit that Government has decided to establish in the Office of the Chief Secretary/ Head

                                                          4
                                                                                                            ISDS


       of the Public Service functions efficiently and effectively.
  l Second, independent Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of public accountability. The project will
       fund contracts for developing and maintaining a cost-efficient system for the M&E of public
       accountability by an independent agency.
  l Third, a Fund for Enhanced Accountability and Transparency (FEAT). The project will establish
       and operate this fund as a vehicle through which all the various demand-driven interventions will be
       supported under the project. Areas for such interventions that have already been identified include
       support to: (i) MDAs in developing their records management and information dissemination systems,
       and implementing their anti-corruption action plans, and (ii) develop and strengthen the watchdog
       functions of civil society organizations.

  Components:

  l Strengthening legal and judicial system
  l Enhancing public financial accountability
  l Strengthening oversight and watchdog institutions
  l Program coordination and management
