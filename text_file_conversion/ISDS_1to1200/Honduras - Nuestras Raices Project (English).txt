A.2. Project Objectives

The project development objective is to contribute to an increased participation of indigenous and Afro-
Honduran groups in the holistic development processes of their communities and their nation, through the
strengthening of local capacity to build sustainable organizations, development projects and cultural
identity.

a. How would the project contribute to:

     Ø Theborrower'shigher-levelobjectivesforthesectorandforpovertyreduction?

The Nuestras Raíces project will contribute to the country's higher-level objective of strengthening the
social protection of indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities by empowering them to manage and
implement their own projects to improve their living conditions with respect for their identity. The project
will provide ethnic communities the opportunity to develop Strategic Ethnic Development Plans that will
complement and feed into the Strategic Municipal Development Plans (Planes Estratégicos de Desarrollo
Municipal, PEDM), thus enabling them to equitably participate in the local development planning process.

The Nuestras Raíces project supports the higher-level objective of enhancing investment in human and
social capital. The project will provide training to ethnic communities, federations, local facilitators and
supervisors. Communities will be trained to formulate Strategic Ethnic Development Plans, plan and
execute projects, and administer funds and materials conferred to their Project Committees.

Furthermore, the project will provide communities and groups of communities with the opportunity to
prioritize, design, manage, execute, monitor and evaluate projects that respond to urgent needs, regardless
of project size. As an important side effect, it will create temporary local employment opportunities for
the participating communities and promote local contracting. It is expected that this will contribute to
reduced rural poverty and increased equity between urban and rural areas.

The gender strategy of Nuestras Raíces will continue to promote equal opportunities for women and
men through contractual services, training opportunities, and the selection of projects benefiting the most
vulnerable segments of ethnic communities.

The environmental sustainability strategy of the Nuestras Raices project promotes environmental
awareness amongst beneficiaries, increase ethnic communities' knowledge about the application of
environmental guidelines and regulations (forestry, water and sanitation, etc.), and address environmental
issues during project implementation through mitigation and risk management measures agreed with and

carried out by beneficiaries.

     Ø TherelevantCASobjective(s)?

The CAS objectives supported by the project are (i) strengthening social protection for specific vulnerable
groups, (ii) reducing rural poverty, and (iii) enhancing investment in human capital. The CAS states that a
core strategic objective of pillar V of the PRSP is "to support Afro-Honduran and indigenous groups to
develop their communities, in part through the Bank-supported "Nuestras Raíces" program."1 This is
entirely consistent with the CAS objectives of poverty reduction by means of addressing the needs of one
of most vulnerable groups identified in the PRSP.
A.3. Project Description

The project has three components:

3.1 Participatory Development Planning by ethnic group: A total of $0.54 million of the loan proceeds
will be invested in assisting each of Honduras' nine indigenous and Afro-Honduran groups to develop a
strategic plan. The purpose of this exercise is threefold: (i) to train and prepare ethnic communities and
their ethnic representations to actively participate in the local development planning process, (ii) to
identify projects to be financed under Nuestras Raíces and other programs, and (iii) to encourage ethnic
federations to work more closely with municipalities to leverage funds. The strategic plans, which will
outline the vision, mission, and strategic goals for each ethnic group, will be led by the ethnic federations
based on an agreed participatory and democratic methodology, using as a starting point, if available,
already existing plans. Facilitators trained by FHIS/NR will assist approximately 2,000 communities to
conduct a participatory community needs assessment and planning process that will result in a Community
Development Plan for each community and a list of their priority sub-projects.

3.2 Grants for Subprojects: An estimated $8.8 million will be invested in an estimated 400 community-
executed projects, each averaging $20,000 in size. These resources will be allocated proportionately
among the nine ethnic groups, based upon the 2001 census data, while guaranteeing a minimum allocation
for the five smallest ethnic groups. Projects will be executed by the ethnic communities, using a
Community Driven Development (CDD) methodology, outlined in the program's Operational Manual
which addresses important gender and environmental aspects. Project funds will be transferred directly to a
community-based Project Implementation Committee (PIC) with a leadership elected or, in those cases
where the group already exists, confirmed, by the entire community.

3.3. Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening: The Nuestras Raíces team, located within
FHIS, will be responsible, as before, for managing the project. It will coordinate closely with the Ethnic
Federations, the community-level Project Implementation Committees, the locally-contracted Sub-project
Formulators and Community Facilitators, and the FHIS-contracted Supervisors and Inspectors for the
successful implementation of the program. The NR team and the FHIS Environmental Unit will coordinate
closely the implementation of the Project's Environmental Action Plan ensuring that environmental
safeguards are observed. To strengthen the capacity of ethnic communities to lead their own development
process, the Nuestras Raíces program will provide training and technical assistance to the communities in
participatory development planning, project identification, planning, execution, operation and maintenance,
and funds and materials management.

Section II ­ Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
In the envisioned participatory development planning process (component 1), gender and environmental
aspects will appropriately taken into account and awareness on these issues will be raised in ethnic
communities. The project cycle includes all the necessary provisions to ensure that subprojects are carried
out in accordance with all relevant environment regulations and safeguards.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area.
N/A.

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
N/A.

D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Nuestras Raíces Technical Unit and the FHIS Environmental Unit, will coordinate closely the
implementation of the Project's Environmental Action Plan assuring environmental safeguards are
observed and sub projects environmental sustainability is foreseen. The identification of subprojects will
come from a participatory approach where environmental awareness will be included in the decision
process. Given the nature of these sub projects, it is expected that negative environmental impacts would
be site-specific due to the nature of the foreseen interventions. The project preparation team has reviewed
the scope and instruments for environmental assessment incorporated in the project's Operating Manual.

The FHIS Nuestras Raíces and Environmental Units will team up in the preparation of training modules
and in the testing of the environmental instruments designed for sub-project appraisal and monitoring. The
Operating Manual has incorporated appropriate instruments that will be used during the implementation
process of the Nuestras Raíces Program.

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Key stakeholders of the project are the indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities who first plan and then
carry out their prioritized subprojects. They will be advised by local technicians and community facilitators
during the entire project. The advisors, in turn, will be supervised by FHIS personnel to ensure that
environmental safeguards are appropriately addressed.

FHIS has developed an Environmental Assessment for the Nuestras Raices project which will be disclosed
before appraisal.
