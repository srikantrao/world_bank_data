B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The main objectives of the proposed project would be to: (i) reduce road deaths and injuries in a 
few carefully selected high-risk inter-city corridors and city areas; and (ii) develop the capability 
of main concerned IRI institutions to address road safety issues.  Performance indicators will 
need to be developed and agreed during project preparation.  Tentatively, key results at the end of 
the project would be the following: (i) road deaths and injuries in proportion to traffic would be 
reduced by [40]% in the high-risk corridors and city areas; (ii) there would be a lead agency 
accountable for road safety, endowed with adequate political support and financial resources; and 
(iii) integrated road safety management procedures and practices would be in place in IRI that 
can be sustained in the longer-term 
 
Beneficiaries
.
The project’s main direct beneficiaries will be all the motorists, motorcyclists, and 
pedestrians who would avoid death, injuries, and personal losses in road accidents as a result of 
the project.  All the dependants of these persons would also be project beneficiaries.  The pool of 
potential beneficiaries is very high as the annual number of fatalities and injuries is over 200,000 
in IRI.

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The project would include two main components: (i) pilot activities that are focused on well-
defined critical geographical areas (high risk road corridors and city areas) to concentrate efforts, 
demonstrate the synergies and higher benefits that result from integrated actions, and produce 
quick, visible results; and (ii) activities at national level to create an enabling environment for 
road safety and to scale up action based on the experience gained in the pilot areas. 
 
Component 1 - For specific road corridors and city areas
,
the project would include: 
 
(a) Removal of hazards in the road environment
.
Black spots would be identified and 
remedied by appropriate civil works. Deficiencies in signage, markings, road 
pavement, road side objects, and other safety facilities would also be systematically 
corrected. 
 
(b) Intensified police enforcement targeting unsafe road user behaviors
.
Police would be 
equipped, trained, and tasked to improve general deterrence enforcement operations.  
This would involve the provision of equipment, especially cars and speed control 
devices, the provision of advice and assistance for preparation and implementation of 
better methods, organization, procedures, and work programs, and training. 
 
(c) Awareness campaigns to support police enforcement operations
.
Information 
programs using television, radio, the press, and other media would be prepared and 
delivered to the public and targeted professional-road users in coordination with 
enforcement activities. 
 
(d) Road safety education for children
.
School and community-based road safety 
programs would be reviewed particularly in primary and secondary schools.  
Improvements (including curriculum and training tools and materials) would be 
designed.  Teachers would be trained.  Improved education would be implemented. 
 
(e) Upgraded emergency medical services
.
In order to improve emergency response 
times and treatment effectiveness, equipment and supplies (such as ambulances, 
communication and medical equipment, and medical supplies) would be provided.  
Better organization and procedures would also be implemented and service suppliers 
would be trained. 
 
Component 2 - At national level
,
the project would include: 
 
(a) Upgraded national road crash data and analysis system
.
Existing data recording and 
analysis systems would be reviewed and improved, especially through the provision 
of
software and hardware to store and process information.  Appropriate procedures 
would also be formulated in order to adequately record information and ensure 
quality control.  The goal would be to design and establish a national system, 
Page  3
accessible by all safety agencies and partners contributing to the improvement of road 
safety outcomes. 
 
(b) Vehicle road worthiness
.
Vehicle road-worthiness standards and vehicle inspection 
requirements would be reviewed.  New standards and requirements would be 
prepared as necessary, and phased in over a suitable period of time.  Procedures and 
facilities for vehicle inspection would also be reviewed and improved including 
through the provision of inspection equipment, if necessary, and the use of public 
private partnerships, if feasible.. 
 
(c) Organization, methods, procedures, guidelines, physical and human resources, and 
work programs for all main IRI agencies involved in road safety
.
These would be 
reviewed, and, based on good international practice and the results achieved with 
Component 1 of the project, improvements would be prepared and implemented 
nationwide, including especially in the areas of road engineering, enforcement, 
education and emergency medical service.  Improvements would include inter alia 
criteria for black spot identification, prioritization methods for remedial measures, 
road safety audit procedures and programs.  A nationwide education program for 
children would be designed.  A plan would also be prepared for upgrading medical 
emergency services nationwide.  A full scale nationwide public awareness campaign 
would be implemented. 
 
(d) Legislative instruments
.
Based on good international practice and the results 
achieved with Component 1 of the project, the adequacy and effectiveness of laws 
and regulations related to road safety, and the instruments for enforcing them, would 
be
reviewed and recommendations for change would be formulated (for example, the 
establishment of traffic courts). 
 
The project’s initial focus on specific high-risk road corridors and city areas is based on the 
lessons of experience and the recommendations of the recent WHO/Bank World Report on Road 
Accident Injury Prevention.  It is proposed that the criteria for the selection of these areas be the 
following: (a) highest concentration of accidents and fatalities per km; (b) variety of 
geographical and climatic conditions; (c) variety of traffic conditions; (d) reasonable cost per km 
of the required physical improvements; and (e) no major environmental and resettlement issues 
linked with the improvements. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The location of road works (mostly removal of black spots as described in Sub-component 1 (a) 
of the project description) is not yet known.  The first year program of works will be identified 
before pre-appraisal on the basis of road accident data as well as a detailed inspection of road 
deficiencies in the selected high risk road corridors and city areas. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Page  4
The Ministry of Roads and Transportation and the Government of the (not more than two or 
three) selected cities will be in charge of the project road works.  At this preliminary stage in 
project preparation, their capacity in environmental management has not yet been reviewed.

was agreed at the PCN Review Meeting that the project EA category would be “B”.  Indeed, 
environmental impacts are not expected to be a main concern as civil works (mostly black spots 
removal) would mainly take place along the existing right of way and only minor land 
acquisition may be required.  An environmental assessment would be carried out and an 
environmental management plan (EMP) prepared for all works implemented as part of the 
project’s first year program.  For works implemented in subsequent years, an environmental 
assessment framework would be formulated during project preparation so that each one of them

can be checked against the framework when the selection takes place.  The framework would be 
agreed before project appraisal.
