Project Objectives (From PDS)

The aim of Electrica Santa Rosa is to identify, develop, build and operate small run-of-the-river
hydropower plants in Peru, bringing hydropower to the National Grid that currently relies on expensive
diesel engines for their electricity needs and/or shaII assist to displace heavy fuel, diesel, coal and gas fired
generation.

Project Description (From PDS)

The Santa Rosa I, II & III, Norte and BeIIavista Hydro Projects are being developed by Electrica Santa
Rosa SAC. AII of the projects are run-of-the-river power generation, capitalizing on flows of irrigation
water in artificial canals. No water will be diverted from natural watercourses for the purpose of these
projects. Santa Rosa II has been operating since August 2004.

T~e installed capacities of the plants are: Santa Rosa I (1.1 MW), Santa Rosa II (1.5 MW), Santa Rosa III
(1.5 MW), Norte (4.4 MW), BeIIavista (1.8 MW).
Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of the
area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other'culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

The Santa Rosa projects are located in the Santa Rosa irrigation district, located in Lima, Province of
~yan, approximately 102 km from Lima. The project uses the water flow of the Huaura river (which is one
of the biggest rivers of the Peruvian Coast). The flows are derived by means of the Santa Rosa Irrigation
Project Water Intake and conducted through 30 km of existing canals to the irrigation. Santa Rosa I,n and
III projects are in cascade and located in the three slopes of the existing canals.

The Norte project is located inside the YauIiyacu Mining Camp, utilizing the conduction canal's cascade
which supplies water to Tinajones Reservoir, located 3 km from village of Chongoyape, Province of
Chiclayo. Water flow of the Chancay River is derived by means of the Raca Rumi Water Intake and
conducted by a canal with capacity to 70m3/sec to the Tinajones Dam.

The Bellavista project is located on the Carretera Central (Central Hwy) about 2 hours East of Lima, near
the City of San Mateo. The project will use the existing civil works of an old Power Plant, some of the
works will have to be built such as the intake, 500 mts of canal and 150 mts oftunne!' The project uses the
water flow of the Rimac river before its confluence with Blanco river.

B. Check Environmental Classification A [ J, B [x], C [ ], FI [ ], TBD [ ]
Comments:
Based on preliminary screening, the subprojects will not have any significant environmental or social
impacts. All potential impacts should be manageable through proper project design and implementation. An
environmental assessment will confirm this conclusion and identify and necessary mitigation measures.

Section II - Key Safe2uard Issues and Their Mana2ement
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available, describe
steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project

Environmental Assessment - The projects will undergo rapid environmental assessments to screen for any
potential environmental and social impacts. Based on preliminary screenings, no significant impacts are
expected. The projects capitalize on existing infrastructure and water derivations, as such, the impacts on
natural habitats and human populations are expected to be minimal. The EA will focus on ecological flow,
the potential impact of the change in flow regime on water users, land ownership and rights-of-way,
neighborhood impacts of the construction, waste disposal/quarry siting and licensing, vulnerability to
natural disasters and requirements of the policies listed below. The EA will audit the design, construction
and environmental management of the Santa Rosa II project (already under implementation), recommend
possible additional mitigation measures for that project and use the findings to inform the environmental
management plans for the other projects.

Natural Habitats - The EA will confirm whether or not the policy is triggered.

Safety of Dams - During the EA, a key aspect that needs to be assessed is the applicability of the Safety of
Dams policies.

Cliitural Property - The EA will confirm whether any cultural heritage sites are nearby, and/or if official
certification is required before construction may begin.

2. (dentify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. Describe any
potential cumulative or long term impacts.

During a period often years (2005 - 2014) the project will displace a total more than 350 thousand tons of
CO 2 which would otherwise be released from thermal plants (using natural gas, coal, diesel and bunker).
This will reduce the contribution of the Peruvian energy sector to global climate change .
 ...
Due to the fact that these projects mainly capitalize on existing infrastructure, in highly intervened
watercourses, no significant environmental effects are expected. Certainly no long-term or large-scale
impacts are foreseen. The EA will confirm this.

3. In light of 1 and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)

The construction of these renewable plants for the purpose of energy generation are considered an
alternative to pollution-generating plants.

4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues

The borrower will undertake an EA following Bank policies. National regulations do not require EA for
projects less than 10 MW.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

The EA will undergo consultation and disclosure per Bank policy before appraisal of the project. To-date,
stakeholders have been involved in the process of assigning water rights.

The projects will create new jobs in construction and plant management. The project sponsors have further
committed to providing electricity to local rural populations. The arrangements for this will be fleshed out
during project preparation. The availability oflow cost electricity will assist local households to improve
their quality oflife, local milling/grinding businesses will benefit, and enable more farmers to irrigate.

The project sponsors have also committed US$l per ton CO 2 to social services in the rural area of Santa
Rosa. Two possibilities are to provide budget support to the local school in Santa Rosa or to finance
educational and vocational training programs for the nearby orphan asylum.

E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[ ] S). - Significant, cumulative andlor irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[x] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionall~ manageable
[ ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[ ] SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
is!iues.
