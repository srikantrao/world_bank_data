                           This activity is part of the SECO Funded Kyrgyz Financial Sector Development Project which aims
                           "to enhance financial sector stability by (i) strengthening the legal and regulatory capacity of NBKR
                           as a financial sector regulator; and (ii) improving financial safety net”.
                           C. Project Description
                           Following the reforms under the current initiatives, the urgency for additional reforms focusing on
                           bank resolution become more apparent. Currently, the resolution framework consists of complex and
                           ineffective tools for bank resolution. Conservatorship is neither designed nor used as a resolution
                           tool, but rather is used as a tool to restore the problem bank’s financial soundness and adherence to
                           prudential norms. During conservatorship, shareholders remain in place and may eventually become
                           the beneficiaries of the NBKR’s efforts. Most of the resolution procedures, including liquidation,
                           restructuring and rehabilitation, take place under court supervision, with the participation of creditors
                           and shareholders, and the Bank Reorganization and Debt Restructuring Agency (DEBRA) acting as
                           the sole liquidator.
                         Importantly, dysfunction of DEBRA significantly undermines the effectiveness of the resolution
                         framework. The DEBRA was established as an entity under the NBKR in 1996, initially to help
                         manage and privatize state-owned banks. This original mandate was to end after five years; however,

                         it subsequently evolved into an asset management company with multiple tasks, and became a more
                         independent entity reporting directly to the President. The DEBRA’s current roles include: (i) the
                         mandatory “special administrator” (liquidator and rehabilitator) of banks in liquidation; and (ii) the
                         collector of debts on behalf of the MOF. The DEBRA considers the rehabilitation of failed banks as
                         its major task hamstringing the bank resolution regime. Many of the liquidation cases that it handles
                         have been lingering for more than a decade, despite the legal time limit of two years. Meanwhile, the
                         DEBRA’s financial reports have not been published nor audited by professional auditors. The bank
                         estates that it manages also require external audits.

                         Hence, the termination of DEBRA’s bank resolution functions following the liquidation of banks
                         under its management will be key to complement ongoing reform efforts as recommended by 2013
                         Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). To address identified weaknesses, the authorities
                         have prepared a new Banking Law which is currently before parliament. One of the aims of the Law
                         is to restrict the potential interventions of the courts, while enhancing the effectiveness of the
                         administrative resolution tools, and enhancing the NBKR’s ind ependence and accountability.
                         However, these reforms could not yield intended results on the resolution framework without the
                         termination DEBRA’s related functions. Accordingly, 2013 FSAP recommends to terminate
                         DEBRA’s functions and granting them to the NBKR.

                         The first step to achieve termination of the DEBRA’s resolution function is to facilitate external audit
                         of the institution and banks under its management. In line with this, SECO and IMF approached the
                         World Bank to take the lead on the implementation of the audit in June 2014. On the preparation
                         stage of the additional financing proposal in December 2014, this component was designed as a
                         bank-executed activity. Nevertheless, during the consultations with relevant departments, the team
                         was informed that execution by the World Bank could not be possible for this particular area of work
                         and the existing trust fund should be transformed into a hybrid one with this component being

                         executed by the recipient. Based on this, SECO decided to provide the initially agreed amount of US
                         $2 million in December 2014 upon the condition that US$336,300 (including taxes) of this amount
                         would be allocated for the DEBRA audit when the authorities decides to implement the audit with a
                         recipient-executed approach. As a result this amount was allocated as contingency to other
                         components until the execution of DEBRA audit.

                         At the beginning of 2015, the World Bank and IMF met with the institutions involved in the audit of
                         DEBRA (DEBRA, the President’s Office, the Ministry of Finance and NBKR) and all parties agreed
                         on the recipient-executed approach and drafted an action plan (see Annex 1 and 2). According to the
                         plan, DEBRA will be the recipient of grant while the Project Implementation Unit at the NBKR will
                         responsible for the implementation. The Ministry of Finance sent their confirmation on DEBRA’s
                         eligibility as a grant recipient in November 2015 (please see Annex 3).
