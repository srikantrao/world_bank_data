 B. Project Objectives
 The proposed development objective of the operation is to improve student outcomes in
      T
 secondary education and the effectiveness of the secondary education system.

 C. Project Description
 The proposed operation consists of two components: (i) a Program for Results (PforR)
 component to support the government’s harmonized secondary education sector program; (ii) a
 Technical Assistance component to support program management, monitoring and evaluation
    of the Program. The Government’s Secondary Education Sector Program supported through
    the PforR component would cover grades 6-12, annually supporting more than 12 million
    students and 300,000 teachers from more than 20,000 general schools, 10,000 Madrasahs and
    1,000 school-based vocational/technical institutions across the country. The following
    preliminary Results Areas have been identified for this component:

    Result Area 1: Enhanced quality and relevance of secondary education
    Result Area 2: Increased equitable access and retention to secondary education
    Result Area 3: Strengthened Governance, Management, and Administration

    This Integrated Safeguards Datasheet (ISDS) pertains to the Technical Assistance (TA)
    component of the program which will be supported through an Investment Project Financing
    (IPF) instrument. About US$20-25 million of the total IDA financing will be allocated towards
    the TA component. Technical Assistance would include provision and utilization of services,
    skills, knowledge and technology in the form of short-term and long-term advisors and
    consultants, consulting firms and non-consulting agencies to support and strengthen the
    capacity of the program implementation and deliver results. TA would primarily support
    Program management, monitoring and evaluation under the Program.

    D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
    (if known)
    The project is expected to be spread nationwide. The project (TA/ IPF component) primarily
    consists of consultancy services to support Program management, monitoring and evaluation
    under the Government’s Secondary Education Sector Program. Therefore no significant, long
    term adverse environment or social impacts are anticipated from the interventions/activities of
    TA.

    The social safeguard policy -- Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) -- has been triggered, given that
    the project covers also the areas where a significant number of tribal peoples1 live including
    the Chittagong Hill Tract and some parts of the plan land especially along the border districts.




    E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
    The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has a long history of working with the Bank and is
    familiar with the Bank’s Safeguard policies and procedures. The current size of the education
    portfolio in Bangladesh is US$1.7 billion and includes six projects.

    The proposed Project is a follow-on to the Secondary Education Quality and Access

1
  Tribal peoples are tribes, minor races, ethnic sects and communities living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and
dispersed in other plain districts in Bangladesh. They are distinct indigenous cultural groups having customary
cultural, economic, social, or political institutions separate from those of the mainstream society and culture. They
have their own indigenous language different than the mainstream Bangla language. These small groups of peoples
have similar characteristics of indigenous peoples covered under the World Bank OP 4.10.
 Enhancement Project (SEQAEP) implemented by the Government of Bangladesh. For
 SEQAEP, GOB had prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)
 incorporating experiences from earlier projects. Through implementation of several Bank
 projects, GOB has developed familiarity to implement ESMF. A number of training was
 imparted on environmental safeguard for the secondary school head masters and environmental
 focal persons of the SEQAEP. Regular monitoring report were shared with World Bank. In
 addition, the TA will include provision to strengthen capacity of the implementation agency to
 ensure adequate capacity for the review and implementation of different safeguard policies.

II. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
 Safeguard Policies                  Triggered ?    Explanation (Optional)
 Environmental Assessment OP/BP      Yes            This policy is triggered because OP 4.10 has
 4.01                                               been triggered. The TA component covers
                                                    consultancy services to support the Secondary
                                                    Education Sector Program under the PforR
                                                    component. TA activities do not include any
                                                    physical facilities and any positive or negative
                                                    environmental or social impacts. However, in
                                                    accordance with the World Bank policy,
                                                    Environmental and Social System Assessment
                                                    is underway which will include the assessment
                                                    of the current SEQEAP project, lessons learnt
                                                    and the revised EMP and updated social
                                                    framework for the activities. The report will
                                                    also cover inclusion, gender and citizen
                                                    engagement as per Bank policy guidelines.

                                                    different beneficiaries. To ensure that TA
                                                    activities do not adversely affect one or more
