 B. Proposed Development Objective(s)

 1.     Program Development Objective: To enhance equitable access to and improve teaching and learning
 environments in government secondary schools with a focus on mathematics and sciences.

 Key Program Results

 2.        The Program is expected to deliver the following results after five years:

 Results area 1: Teachers with the skills and motivation to teach all children.


August 21, 2017                                                                                                    Page 2 of 6

 -   Skills. Improve the quality of teaching through regular training that provides skills to identify and support at-risk
     learners, greater system support to teachers through improved school leadership, use of ICT and online resources
     for science and mathematics and improved assessment
 -   Motivation. Stronger financial and non-financial incentives for teachers, greater accountability between schools and
     local communities, stronger school leadership

 Results area 2: Adequate learning environments to support teaching and learning.

 -   Sufficient mathematics and science teachers in secondary schools
 -   Expanded access and reduced class sizes in science and mathematics
 -   Provision of adequate and good quality teaching and learning materials
 -   Improved access to practical science through laboratory provision and innovative approaches to science teaching
     through ICT (e.g. virtual laboratories)

 3.        Gender differences in secondary school performance will be addressed directly in both results areas. In the
 first results area, a central component of the envisaged in-service teacher training will be to equip teachers with the
 skills to support at-risk learners and particularly girls. The results area also focuses on providing incentives for teachers
 to focus on girls’ performance. In the second results area, specific improvements in facilities are expected to have larger
 impacts on girls’ performance. For example, improved water and sanitation facilities in schools are especially important
 for the well-being of adolescent girls making the transition to puberty and can support better school attendance and
 performance. Activities under the proposed program to strengthen school-community engagement are also expected to
 contribute by tackling some of the external factors (e.g. demands on girls’ time in the household) that hamper girls’
 education outcomes.

 C. Concept Description

 Government program

 4.      The scope of the proposed operation will also include a technical assistance IPF component. This component is
 designed to carefully identify critical trade-offs, needs assessments, cost-effectiveness and sustainability of proposed
 approaches in responding to the challenges emerging in the secondary education sector. TA support provided by DFID
 for EPforR created an implementation feedback loop encouraging adaptive learning and timely course correction that
 has proved critical in keeping implementation on track. The free basic education policy and the expected increase in
 lower and upper secondary enrolments creates TA needs beyond current EPforR activities, which will be supported
 through the proposed operation. The purpose of the Technical Assistance and Capacity Building Component of the
 proposed PforR operation is to provide implementation support and build the capacity of MoEST, PO-RALG and NECTA
 to manage the expansion of the sector. Proposed activities will include:
      Analytical work to develop an evidence-based approach to inform trade-offs involved in sector expansion and
         support the development of more cost-effective approaches to secondary education service delivery
      Further develop the EMIS system to improve information for education planning in secondary schooling with a
         focus on improving information on teachers (e.g. subjects taught, trainings needed and received)
      Further development of national framework for continuous professional development and its operational plan
      Support the development of a Form IV national assessment
      Pilot gender informed and gender focused interventions

         Support to build sustainable capacity in the sector for effective policymaking, planning, implementation and
          monitoring and evaluation

 The implementation arrangements for the TA component will be elaborated during preparation.

  SAFEGUARDS

  A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

  25.    The program is located in mainland Tanzania. The proposed activities under the TA component consist primarily
  of consultancy services and evaluation studies and no significant, long term or adverse environmental or social issues are
  anticipated from the proposed interventions/activities. The TA component under the PforR has no physical footprint and
  would involve capacity building, analytics and assessments.

  B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

  26.    The recent environment and social systems assessment undertaken for the EPforR additional financing in April
  2017 concluded that in general, the national regulatory framework for environmental and social management in
  Tanzania is consistent with the Bank PforR Policy and Directive in terms of principles and key elements. The legal
  framework provides a reasonable basis for addressing environment, health, safety and social issues likely to arise from
  the TA activities. Technical guidelines and national plans/programs exist for environmental and social due diligence
  with respect to education. Moreover, Environmental and Social Management Frameworks under previous World Bank
  funded education projects have been deemed satisfactory in their implementation.

  C. Environmental and Social Safeguards Specialists on the Team

 Jane Kibbassa – Environmental Safeguards Specialist
 Mary Bitekerezo – Social Safeguards Specialist

  D. Policies that might apply

  27.     Since the IPF TA component only includes consultancy services, evaluation studies and capacity building activities
  it is not expected to trigger any safeguards policies. There are no safeguard instruments expected under the TA, based
  on the activities it will support, and no policies are triggered.

  E. Safeguard Preparation Plan

  28.    Tentative target date for preparing the first draft of ESSA and appraisal Stage PID/ISDS is 17 November 2017 with
  the final documents completed by 30 November 2017.
