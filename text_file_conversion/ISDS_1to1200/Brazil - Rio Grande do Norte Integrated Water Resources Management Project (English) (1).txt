B.  Project Objectives  
 
Project Objectives
:
The main objectives of the Project are to develop the institutional and 
operational framework and the necessary infrastructure to optimize the integrated management 
and sustainable use of water resources in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, focused on 
rural areas, including the rehabilitation and expansion of irrigation infrastructure, and to enhance 
its links to other state policies regarding strengthening of poverty reduction and economic 
growth in those areas. The ultimate goal of the project would be to reduce the vulnerability of the 
State’s rural poor to cyclical droughts.  
 
Project Outcomes and Outputs:
 
(i) 
preserve and protect the quantity and quality of water and environmental resources, as 
well as restoring those which are jeopardized, by:  
·
optimizing, expanding if necessary and, whenever possible, integration of numerous 
individual public water supplies as well as individual sanitary sewer systems, especially 
in small and medium-sized communities, in a manner that is compatible with the water 
availability and regional needs of populations;  
·
strengthening the concept of multiple use of natural resources, especially water resources; 
Page  2
·
assigning priority to the implementation of pertinent water structures, so that they may be 
linked to existing water infrastructure, according to the Program’s guidelines; 
·
defining those actions that best provide the basis for a program to function as a pilot for 
future state interventions in the water resources sector  
(ii) 
increase focus and efficiency of efforts to fight drought conditions by: 
·
improving collaboration between scientists and administrators to enhance the efficacy of 
observation networks, by means of monitoring, forecasting, transferring information, and 
applied research, and thus increasing the public’s understanding of and preparation for 
drought; 
·
incorporating planning, implementation of proactive mitigation plans and measures, risk 
management, provision of resources, environmental considerations and public education, 
as key elements to effective state monitoring of drought conditions; 
·
broadly defining the interventions needed to implement new works, provided that they 
are related to water resources, in order to strengthen existing infrastructure, for the 
specific purpose of combating drought; 
(iii) 
establish mechanisms for the linkage and participation of elected officials, the private 
sector and urban and rural communities in water and other natural resources 
management. 
 
C.  Project Description  
 
The project proposed focuses on full integration of water resources management, with impact not 
only on water resources but on other natural resources as well, and different sectors such as 
economic development and human development.
.
One alternative that was considered was to 
propose a project that would deal strictly with water infrastructure, including rehabilitation and 
expansion of irrigation infrastructure. The project team, together with the Government of RG 
Norte also weighed short-term versus long-term interventions. However, based on the 
expectations that the Federal Government will continue its work with Pró-Água Semi-Árido, 
coupled with the fact that the sector will remain a priority to State Government, a decision was 
taken to pursue an integrated water resources management project, with a focus as previously 
stated, that would have infrastructure construction and rehabilitation, natural resources 
management and insitutitonal development as some of its components. Moreover, the limited 
debt capacity of the State prompted the proposal of an APL, with a relatively small loan (about 
US$ 15.0 million in each phase) as the best financial instrument for the project. 
 
Project Components 
 
The proposed project would have the following components: 
 
1.- Water Infrastructure Component:
 Under this component the project would finance 
activities directed at improving water availability, such as: (i) new water-related works, including 
river bed dredging and construction of new hydraulic works; (ii) works for the conservation, 
rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing water infrastructure; (iii) increased and improved 
water supply for very poor, diffuse rural populations in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, 
through  
inter alia
 social mobilization and community promotion, development of projects and 
Page  3
works, installation of cisterns, provision of well drilling equipment and the development of a 
cadastre of rural communities.  
 
2.- Institutional Development:
 The aim of this component would be 
to improve the State’s 
water resources management capabilities, through activities such as:  
·
review of the existing legal framework for water resources management, including the 
development and implementation of a water rights system ;  
·
strengthening of the State Secretariat of Water Resources and the Water Management 
Agency. 
·
improvement of the water resources monitoring and evaluation network and a water 
resources information system, including the development of a water resources map;  
·
formation or strengthening of water user’s associations, including the development of a 
system of water user fees to guarantee their financial sustainability;  
·
updating of the State Water Resources Management Plan;  
·
development and implementation of a decision-making support system;  
·
training program, including formal and informal environmental education programs;  
·
implementation of a water quality and conservation program, through formal and 
informal environmental education programs, and projects to mitigate water losses in 
public water supplies and in state-owned public water supply infrastructure; to conserve 
water in agricultural and industrial activities, and to generate water-saving technologies 
and products 
 
3.- Conservation and Protection of Natural Resources: 
The Natural Resources component 
would support the preservation of water quality, improve the efficiency in water use and promote 
the adoption of sustainable cultural practices on irrigated lands through: (i) conservation-oriented 
planning in microcatchments, which would promote soil conservation and erosion alleviation, as 
well as the recuperation of gallery forests and the regulation of agrochemical use; (ii) support to 
municipalities in dealing with water contamination management in areas identified as a priority 
for water resources preservation 
 
4.- Special Studies
:
This component would provide support to undertake several studies of 
importance for water resources management in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. The main 
studies already identified cover issues related to: (i) multiple uses of water in current reservoirs; 
(ii) emergency plans for water-related disaster situations (droughts and floods); (iii) 
hydrogeology and hydrodynamics of aquifers; and (iv) new environmental protection area. 
 
5.- Project Executing Unit.  
The project would finance the staff and the technical assistance 
required to implement the project
.
.
In addition, transversal actions will be carried out.  They promote focusing and integration of 
activities of the different components in specific geographical areas, in order to achieve not only 
integration between different uses of water resources, but integration of water resources 
management with other state policies regarding social and economic development, in order to 
leverage their development impact.

D.  Project location  
 
The project will be implemented over the whole State of Rio Grande do Norte. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
The project will be implemented by the Secretariat of Water Resources 
–
SERHID. An 
environmental consultant will be hired by the State to assist SERHID on safeguard-related 
issues. A Sectoral  Environmental Assessment will be conducted at the early stages of project 
preparation, to provide environmental and social inputs to the project preparation process and 
analysis of alternatives.  
 
Currently, environmental licensing of infrastructure projects in Rio Grande do Norte is the 
responsibility of IDEMA – Instituto de Desenvolvimento Economico e Meio Ambiente (Institute 
for Economic Development and the Environment), under the State Secretariat of Planning and 
Finance. The Sectoral Environmental Assessment will also carry out an analysis of IDEMA’s 
current procedures and capacity for environmental licensing.  In case the need for involuntary 
resettlement is identified, resettlement specialist will be added to the Bank and the State project 
preparation teams. 
 
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
 
The specific investments to be made under this project will only be determined during project 
preparation, and for this reason it is still too early to know exactly which safeguard policies 
might be triggered by the project. However, based on past operations of a similar scope, this 
project might trigger the following safeguard policies:

If TBD, explain determinants of classification and give steps that will be taken to determine that 
EA category (mandatory): The project will receive either an “A” or “B” classification, depending 
on the nature and severity of potential negative impacts of specific infrastructure to be financed 
under the project. The project team will contact the QAT for a final decision on project 
classification once the major types of specific investments to be financed have been identified.  
 
As part of project preparation, an initial Environmental Assessment will be conducted to 
examine the current in-state capacity to manage the most common environmental and social 
issues associated with water resources management projects, and to evaluate the history of past 
investments regarding their environmental and social impacts.
