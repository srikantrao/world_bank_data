A.2. Project Objectives 
The purpose of the TAL is to ensure that finance is immediately available to assist the 
design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the reform arrangements, and 
facilitate compliance with the adjustment loans policy matrix triggers, as well as to 
ensure that the Bank safeguard policies applicable to SECALs, namely OP4.01 in this 
case, are complied with. 
By doing so, the TAL will contribute to meet the development objectives of the overall 
project. These include among others the reduction in travel and waiting times for public 
transport users, in particular for low-income groups, improvement of air quality, noise 
reduction and efficiency increase of Santiago’s urban transport system to the benefit of 
all residents. 
In addition, part of the interventions financed through the TAL aim at optimizing the fare 
structure and bus service design to maximize benefits for the poor, building on the 
conclusions of a study on the distributional effects of the new system. The main expected 
project outputs are: 
• 
A wider support for the Santiago Urban Transport Plan and the preventive removal of 
obstacles that could hinder the success of its implementation;  
• 
A more in-depth understanding of the impact of Transantiago on the public transport 
labor force, on people with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups, and the 
definition and implementation of corrective actions; 
• 
Adequately retrained transit worker with greater chances of being reinserted into the 
employment market; 
Page  3
 
 
• 
Improved public transport network and service planning and thus a more effective 
and efficient system; 
• 
A more in-depth understanding of the impacts of Transantiago air quality and noise, 
and greater compliance with environmental targets; 
• 
A better coordination between the transport and land use planning functions; 
• 
A number of evaluation and survey tools that will allow to enhance the quality, 
effectiveness and efficiency on the urban transport system on a continuous basis; 
• 
Institutional strengthening as far as resettlement processes are concerned; 
• 
Increased skills in terms of system evaluation, planning and improvement. 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The components of the TAL are:  
1.  Survey regarding the perception of the current and future service levels of the 
Santiago public transport system. 
2.  Evaluation of the impact of the increased number of transfers on the public transport 
demand. The results of the study will constitute the basis to fine-tune the bus route 
restructuring scheme in order to maximize the positive impacts especially on low-
income groups living in the city outskirts and most likely to incur multiple transfers. 
3. 
Pilot testing of the Transantiago user information system.  
4.  Design and implementation of an information system for Transantiago users with 
disabilities and capacity building.. 
5.  Design of a control mechanism and preparation of the respective laws and norms to 
carrying out the technical inspection of the concession contracts and the services 
complementary to the transport system. 
6.  Impact analysis of Transantiago on the transport demand. 
7.  Impact analysis of the Transantiago on urban development. 
8. 
Basic monitoring of the air quality: implementation of a system to measure the impact 
of public transport on the air quality and creation of an information system.  
9. Further development and validation of the economic model MODEC (Social 
evaluation of the project incorporating environmental benefits). 
10. Assessment of the changes in drivers’ quality of life due to the implementation of 
Transantiago. The study will permit to identify the changes in attitude and aptitude of 
transport workers, and their adaptation capacity to the new systems. It will also help 
to spot and prevent potential conflict situations. 
11. Fine-tuning of the evaluation of the impacts of Transantiago, mainly in terms of travel 
time, travel cost, and number of transfers before and after the public transport 
modernization.. 
12. Strengthening of the current resettlement framework, including socio-economic 
studies, legal framework, indemnification costs and other requirements necessary to 
improve current practices.

works. 
14. Capacity building, business creation and re-conversion of transport sector workers. 
Specific programs will be developed to provide redundant public transport workers 
with the opportunity to acquire the necessary skills to establish themselves as small 
enterprises or to retrain them for reinsertion into the labor market. 
15. Design of mechanisms for the co-ordination of land use and transport planning, 
especially focusing on housing location.  
16. Periodic updating of the Origin-Destination survey, in order to allow for the 
continuous planning of the new public transport system of Santiago.  
17. Analysis and update of the traffic forecast models (ESTRAUS).  
18. Design of a recuperation strategy for public spaces that become available because of 
traffic congestion reduction in the framework of Transantiago. These spaces will 
mainly be used at the benefit of pedestrians, cyclists, for green areas and public 
spaces. 
 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The project area of influence is the Santiago Metropolitan Area, as the transport system 
will be changed as a result of the public transport modernization under PTUS.

Comments: 
The project environmental and social impacts are positive. It will help the implementation of 
TRANSANTIAGO, through monitoring public perception, and environmental and transport indicators; and 
through improving data to help provide feedback into the operation of the system. It will also help maintain 
the standard of living of displaced workers from the system through capacity building and social work. 
Finally, the project will strive to elevate the standard treatment of involuntary resettlements in the city, 
drawing inspiration from Bank’s safeguard policies.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The TAL will help upgrade the existing guidelines for EMP of infrastructure works, and the current 
involuntary resettlements policy framework 
 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area.

D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Chile has a relatively high capacity and standards for managing environmental and social 
safeguards. There is a well instituted system for environmental impact assessment of 
projects with potentially high impacts, regulated by Law 19.300. Depending on the type 
of projects, and on the anticipated level of impact, projects need to enter the national 
System of Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) with either a full EIA or a 
Declaration of Environmental Impact. SEIA is a single window system operated by the 
National Commission on Environment (CONAMA), where all relevant authorities and 
the public have the chance to provide feedback and recommendations on the proposed 
project.  
 
Similarly, there is a law governing all involuntary resettlements resulting from 
expropriations based on public interest, which sets the legal framework to compensate or 
ensure that the livelihood conditions of property owners are preserved. Other affected 
people (tenants, encroachers and other informal residents) can get compensation if 
mandated by a judge.  All affected households are helped by SERVIU’s social specialists, 
to apply for housing subsidies or low-interest programs existing for low income 
population. To cover the cases not protected by the law, MOP uses the environmental 
legal framework to determine compensation for all other residents.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

operators. Meetings and information about potential resettlements have already taken 
place. In addition, communities of areas where current land-use patterns are not in 
compliance with land-use plans are constantly being contacted and informed. Open 
consultation has also taken place with bus operators. The accompanying adjustment loans 
will require workshops with community participation, and dissemination of the urban 
transport plan.
