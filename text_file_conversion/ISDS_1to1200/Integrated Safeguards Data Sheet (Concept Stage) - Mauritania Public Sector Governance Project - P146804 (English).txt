B. Project Objectives
14.    The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to: Support the implementation of the
Government of Mauritania's public sector reforms for improved forecasting, management, oversight
and control of public assets and natural resources for inclusive and poverty-oriented growth.
15.    This will be achieved through better fiscal forecasting for the budget process, improved


﻿monitoring of SOE performance, audits and control, a stronger tax administration, including the
mining sector, operability of electronic PFM systems, and evidence based policy making through
better data and statistics.
C. Project Description
The project is an investment project which is expected to comprise four separate components: (i)
forecasting, budgeting and management of government finances to benefit of the Ministry of
Finance; (ii) oversight and monitoring of state-owned enterprises and public agencies to the benefit
o       of MoF and SOEs; (iii) mining sector governance support to the benefit of Ministry of Petroleum,
Energy and Mines and MoF; and (iv) Support to national statistics to the benefit of the National
Statistics Office.
Component 1: Improved systems, management and capacity for budget forecasting/planning,
execution and control.
This component is destined to further develop the BOOST methodology of developing modules for
planning and execution of the medium-term expenditure framework. The component will also
expand the public financial management system which integrates the functions of Treasury, tax
administration, customs and human resources. Support and capacity building will also be provided to
enhanced tax administration at central and local level. Finally, procurement practices will be
supported through review of existing legislation and capacity building of staff.
Component 2: Oversight and monitoring of State Owned Enterprises and Public Agencies.
The Central Ownership Unit will receive support in developing a strategy and defining objectives for
ownership of the State in enterprises and agencies. The support will include training of staff,
improvement of audit and reporting procedures as well as refinement of procedures for performance
evaluation and transparency in decision-making.
Component 3: Improved mining sector governance.
The component will build on the achievements of previous mining sector support in order to build
capacity for fiscal modelling and revenue collection from private and state-owned mining operations.
This is envisioned to be realized through training of staff from MPEM and MoF and eventually
development of a Large Tax-Payer's Unit covering the mining industry. This component will also
enhance the knowledge of mineral resources through interpretation of geo-science data from areas
which are considered to have high potential for mineral development. As part of this activity focused
on identifying potential areas of development for the sector, this component will also finance the
preparation of Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) for the mining sector which
will help Finally, performance monitoring and oversight will be supported through an expansion of
existing monitoring and reporting systems, including training of staff.
Component 4: National Statistics Support.
Training will be provided to staff of the National Statistics Office and the infrastructure and
equipment of the agency will be supported. Moreover, surveys of productive sectors (such as
enterprise survey as well as agriculture and livestock survey) are planned.
D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
The project will not finance any investment in physical structures or buildings. It is expected that
hardware investments will focus on IT systems upgrades and development. Equipment will also be
purchased for environmental and geological surveys. The majority of the planned activities are not


﻿location-specific since support will be provided to capacity building of ministerial staff including
planning and policy development and drafting of legislation.
One project activity will involve a study on the Nouadhibou-Zouerate corridor to assess its mineral
U       prospectivity and its potential for economic and social development. The corridor is located in the
Sahara desert with limited population except from the urban center in the fishing and port city
Nouadhibou and the urban development in Zouerate where mining activities have taken place for
more than 60 years. Socio-economic surveys (2004, 2011 and 2013) have found that the population
scores higher on social and economic indicators than the national average. This is ascribed to the
economic opportunities associated to the mining industry as well as the trading and fishing potential
along the coast around Nouadhibou.
E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and Mines has a clearly developed institutional framework with
regard to environmental and social compliance in which the Department of Operational Oversight
and Environment (Direction du Suivi des Projets et de l'Environnement) is responsible for
monitoring and enforcement. A computerized system has been developed (through the previous 2nd
Mining Sector Capacity Building Project) to follow mining operations from the initial award of
license to final mine closure.
Notwithstanding, implementation of the computerized system has been somewhat hampered by
limited human and financial resources as well as deficiencies in inter-ministerial collaboration.

0


﻿Environmental Assessment      Yes           The growth of the mining industry with the
OP/BP 4.01                                  emergence of a large number of operators requires
the strengthening of systems and capacities to
monitor and control not only the technical aspects of
production but also along the social and
environmental dimensions. Further, one project
activity will involve a study on the Nouadhibou-
Zouerate corridor to assess its mineral prospectivity
and its potential for economic and social
development. To support the decision-making and
planning process under these two activities and to
ensure that environmental and possibly other
sustainability aspects are effectively considered, a
Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment
(SESA) for the mining sector is planned under the
mining sector governance component. . This
assessment follows the environmental assessment
which was conducted prior to the PRISM-2 project in
2003.
Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04   No            No activities are planned in protected natural habitats
Forests OP/BP 4.36            No            The 2003 assessment noted that forests are well
identified.
Pest Management OP 4.09       No            This safeguard is not applicable for the project.
Physical Cultural Resources   No            Policies and procedures for management of chance
OP/BP 4.11                                 finds will be included in the environmental and
o                                      social assessment.
Indigenous Peoples OP/BP      No            No indigenous people are identified.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/  No            As no infrastructure work or other construction work
BP 4.12                                     is planned for the project, this safeguard is not
triggered. The existing framework in place in
Mauritania for addressing resettlement issues will be
assessed as part of the sectorwide environmental and
social assessment.

III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN
A. Tentative target date for preparing the PAD Stage ISDS: 01-Sep-2015
1 Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the InfoShop and (ii) in country, at publicly accessible locations and in a
form and language that are accessible to potentially affected persons.


﻿B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
The specific studies and their timingi should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
An assessment of institutional capacities in place in Mauritania will be conducted prior to or
during appraisal. The planned sectorwide environmental and social assessment will be conducted
within the first 18 months of project implementation
