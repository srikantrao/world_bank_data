I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
         The project will contribute to the implementation of Moldova's Economic Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy by empowering poor communities and vulnerable population groups to manage their
priority development needs through: (i) development of the capacity of the community institutions to
provide quality basic social and economic services; (ii) strengthening social capital; and (iii) establishing
regular feedback mechanism to reflect their experience in the changing national policies.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
         The project will provide funding for implementation of activities under the four main components
briefly outlined below.

         Component 1 ­ Community Development finances activities under three sub-components: (i) rural
community development; (ii) small town community development; and (iii) community capacity building.

         Component 2 ­ Social Care Services Development finances activities under the following two
sub-components: (i) social care services sub-projects; and (ii) capacity building local government and
service providers.

         Component 3 ­ Communication, Monitoring and Evaluation and Capacity Building provides
funding for the following three sub-components: (i) capacity building of governmental institutions and
learning of policy lessons; (ii) communication, dissemination and replication of best practices; and (iii)
monitoring and evaluation.

         Component 4 ­ Project Management provides funding for project implementation and mainly
support the SIF Executive Office operations.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

         The project will finance communities in rural and urban (small cities) areas. Micro-projects will be
small in size and unlikely to have adverse environment effects. To address environmental concern, the
Operational Manual for the project will contain appropriate environmental criteria. Environmental screening

                                                        2
                                                                                                          ISDS


will be required for all microprojects. If appropriate mitigation measures cannot be implemented for any given
micro-project, then that micro-project will not be eligible for funding.


B. Check Environmental Classification: F (Financial Intermediary Assessment)

Comments: This project has been rated FI (Financial Intermediary) because SIF II is a social fund that
provides financing for demand-driven micro-projects. Because the bulk of the project activities will be
demand-driven micro-projects that cannot be identified prior to appraisal, rather than carrying out
environmental assessment as part of project preparation, a mechanism for screening microprojects for their
environmental impact will be included in the operational manual prior to appraisal. Environmental assessment
will then be carried out for specific micro-projects and/or micro-projects sites as appropriate.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The project does not entail any new construction and is focused on rehabilitation of infrastructure.
Currently, land acquisition is not envisaged under the micro-projects based on the implementation
experience under the SIF I Project. No new construction activities requiring new land acquisition is
expected in the micro-projects. Water and gas pipe lines that may need to be laid may cause temporary loss
of access to land; but this is simply a matter of inconvenience and does not constitute land acquisition.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
The micro-projects are community driven and any potential cumulative impacts will be determined only during
micro-project appraisal. The analysis will be carried out as outlined in the Operating Manual.

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
The potential long term impacts can only be determined once the SIF and a community have agreed on the
micro-project. The appraisal and evaluation will be carried out based on the agreed Guidelines, as reflected
in the Operating Manual.

         A project identification workshop with participation of different stakeholders took place on March
20, 2003 during the project identification mission. The participants acknowledged that during the
implementation of SIF 1 there has been close cooperation with various stakeholders. The intention is to
closely cooperate with all stakeholders during the course of preparation of the SIF 2 project. The purpose
of this participation is two-fold: (i) ensure the inputs from stakeholders, which will contribute to the best
quality of SIF 2 as a response to the needs of beneficiaries and to the development challenges of the
country; (ii) generate stakeholder ownership of SIF, which will contribute to their participation in the
implementation of SIF 2. The identification workshop contributed to the development of the stakeholder
participation plan that is outlined below taking into consideration project preparation milestones.

There will be various modalities for stakeholder participation in the preparation of SIF 2, such as:
(a)      Workshops to address issues and provide inputs
(b)      Participation in working groups on specific issues
(c)      Bilateral work and negotiations between SIF and specific institutions to jointly address specific
questions
(d)      Stakeholders providing baseline information of importance for project design

The following working groups will be established to address cross cutting issues:
         Group 1:          Rural community micro projects:
·        Targeting
·        Typology
·        Resources allocation
·        Decision making mechanisms
·        Community Capacity
·        Coordination with other projects and programs, institutions and donors
         Group 2:          Pilot projects for small towns
·        Selection of pilot municipalities
·        Working modality
·        Mechanism for participation
·        Capacity building of local governments
·        Typology
·        Criteria
         Group 3:          Social care services development:

·        Financing of social care services
·        Typologies
