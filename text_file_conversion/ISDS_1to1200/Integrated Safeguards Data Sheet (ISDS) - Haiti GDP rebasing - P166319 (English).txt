                           Strengthening the capacity of the Haiti Statistical Office (IHSI) through the rebasing of GDP.

                           C. Project Description
                           Through re-basing of the national accounts to 2012 the project aims to capture structural changes that may
                           have taken place in the Haitian economy since 1986-87, which is the current base year used for the National
                           Account estimates through which the gross domestic product (GDP) is computed.

                           The project will engage a full-time resident technical advisor that will provide guidance, training, advice and
                           assistance in leading the GDP rebasing exercise in order to ensure the exercise is successfully carried out and
                           to transfer knowledge and capacity to IHSI staff so that such exercises can be completed in-house in the
                           future.
