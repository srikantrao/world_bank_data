The potential investment is intended to help those in rural areas have equal access to a quality 
education and learning opportunities and support the government in its management of the 
sector.  As a result of project implementation, Mongolia will increase the share of students in 
rural areas who enter and complete the primary schooling and or its equivalency and narrow the 
achievement gap between rural area and larger population centers.  The summary below 
organizes potential project activities by component.
