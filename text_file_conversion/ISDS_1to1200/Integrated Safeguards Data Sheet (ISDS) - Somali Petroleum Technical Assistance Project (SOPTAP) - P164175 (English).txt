                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           To strengthen the institutional framework and the capacity of the Somali petroleum sector to manage the sector and
                           wealth for sustainable development impacts.

                           C. Project Description
                           Component 1: Facilitate inclusive agreement

                           Building on political accommodation and knowledge building work over the past two years, FGS now
                           considers to establish a Forum to develop the agreement on ownership, management and revenue sharing of
                           petroleum resources, which needs support to facilitate this sensitive process (outputs: logistics support,
                           secretariat, experts on call).

                           Component 2: Strengthen capacity in the sector
Public Disclosure Copy




                           Institutional development of the Somalia Petroleum Authority (SPA). Based on previous work to develop the
                           legal and regulatory framework for the SPA, support is now required to train the staff of the SPA and enable
                           them to run the SPA, govern and regulate agreements, and develop the petroleum policy and strategy
                           (output: reports).

                           Component 3: Project Management

                           This component will finance costs associated with overall project implementation. An annual work plan will
                           be agreed between the Implementing Agency and the Bank to establish the parameters of the costs and
                           activities to be financed under this component.

                          D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                          analysis (if known)
                          The project will not support any construction activities on the ground and will focus on capacity building
                          activities, including policy dialogues, training and report preparation. As a consequence, none of the
                          envisaged activities under the project are expected to have a footprint with adverse environmental or social
                          impact that could be categorized as sensitive, diverse or precedent setting. The project will not provide
                          support to land use planning or spatial planning. The activities under the project will be related only to the
                          onshore areas of Somalia as well as to those areas offshore the coast of Somalia that are not disputed. The
                          proposed Project Area will therefore be defined to exclude any disputed areas, whether onshore or offshore.
                          As a consequence, none of the envisaged activities are expected to have any impact on any areas that may
                          be the subject of a dispute between Somalia and any of the neighboring countries.

                          E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                          Petroleum is a new sector in Somalia with small exploration projects starting up. The development of
                          consultative structures and arrangements for dialogue will need to take this uncertainty into account.
                          Somalia has some environmental regulation, policies and standards, but few of them are petroleum sector
                          specific. The FGS may have to develop petroleum-specific policies and regulations on involuntary
                          resettlements.
