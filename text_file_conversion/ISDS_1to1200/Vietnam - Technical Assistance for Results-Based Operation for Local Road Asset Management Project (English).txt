 (if known)


 a.      The geographical scope of Project activities varies. There are many ethnic
 communities, in the mountainous and poorest areas where the activities related to monitoring
 will be implemented. The Project will specially target ethnic minorities, in the Northern
 Mountain, and Central Highland with a large ethnic minority population, differentiated cultural
 profiles, and customary traditions. Support will be provided to maximize the ethnic minority
 access and benefits in these lagging behind regions, with an approach that requires to be
 customized according to diversity across ethnic groups.

                                       However, given that a large part of the TA will
                                       be focused on capacity building and monitoring
                                       to take into account Indigenous Peoples, the Op
                                       4.10 on Indigenous Peoples is triggered.

                                       The ESSA concludes that the EMs legal
                                       framework is robust, while the implementation
                                       of the regulations related to EMs, information
                                       disclosure, and social participation at local level
                                       is not consistent with the policies in place.
                                       There is a lack of accountability due to the
                                       limited information flowing to communes and
                                       participation of EMs in decision making
                                       remains limited. Specific actions are needed to
                                       close these gaps.

                                       The TA capacity building and training activities

 A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the project. Identify and describe
 any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

5|Page
 The TA and its associated project does not entail any potential large scale, significant and/or
 irreversible negative impacts. The potential impacts of the PforR Program of the Operation are
 addressed through the ESSA instrument. The key features of the TA component which trigger OP 4:01
 on Environment Assessment as the safeguards umbrella policy and OP 4.10 are described in Section 6.
 2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
 the project area:
 The Project is not expected to cause any long-term negative impacts on the ground. On the contrary, it
 will strengthen the capacity of municipal government to manage social and environmental risks.
 3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
 impacts.
 Not applicable.
 4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
 assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
 The assessment of the borrower’s capacity to plan and implement the measures described in the TA
 are contained in the LRAMP’s Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) as the project
 associated to the TA is a LRAMP is a PforR Operation.

 The TA objective of activities a) and b) is to strengthen environmental management capacity of the
 Directorate for Road of Vietnam and Project Management Units under the Ministry of Transport in
 order to ensure compliance to Vietnam environmental requirements and the application of good
 environmental practices in the Local Road Asset Management Program (LRAMP).

 The Technical Assistance (TA) will cover environmental and social management training and
 independent monitoring based upon the objectives and principles of the World Bank safeguards
 policies under OP 4.01. As the umbrella policy, OP 4.01 on Environment Assessment covers other
 relevant safeguards policies applicable under the TA.

 The TA objective of activities a) and b) is to strengthen environmental management capacity of the
 Directorate for Road of Vietnam and Project Management Units under the Ministry of Transport in
 order to ensure compliance to Vietnam environmental requirements and the application of good
 environmental practices in the Local Road Asset Management Program (LRAMP).

 5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
 safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
 Project key stakeholders are the staff of GoV agencies responsible for planning, implementing,
 monitoring and evaluating ethnic minority access and benefits in lagging behind regions at national
 level, with an approach that requires to be customized according to diversity across ethnic groups.
 Using the current arrangement, PMUs will arrange adequate staff time to ensure that social-related
 issues (land acquisition, land donation, gender mainstreaming, EM participation) will be properly
 tracked, monitored and reflected in the relevant Program report for documentation and tracking. A
 detailed scope or work for this unit/staff will be developed prior to the actual implementation of the
 Program.

 The TA and PforR Program will use this same structure for the additional consultation process that
 will result in the development of key outputs outlined in the ESSA.
