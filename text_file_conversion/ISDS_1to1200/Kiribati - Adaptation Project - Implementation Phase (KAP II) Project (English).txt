B.  Project Objectives  
The key goal of the Kiribati Adaptation Program is to reduce Kiribati’s vulnerability to climate change, 
climate variability, and sea level rise. 
 
The first Phase of the Program (Preparation, KAP I) is on-going, and funding the initial mainstreaming of 
climate change adaptation into national economic planning, as well as preparation for the Investment Phase 
(KAP II).  
 
The objective of the proposed Pilot Implementation Phase of KAP (KAP II) is to implement pilot adaptation 
measures, and consolidate mainstreaming of adaptation into national economic planning.
 
C.  Project Description  
The project is expected to include the following components:  
 
·
Component 1. Priority National Adaptation Investments (US$1.5 million). 
 This component would finance 
public 
adaptation investments
 in key vulnerable sectors, identified as national priorities and mainstreamed into 
sectoral Ministries’ Operational Plans.  Its objective would be to progressively reinforce adaptation 
Page  2
i
nvestments across the Government’s budget and sectoral plans, making the national economy less 
vulnerable to climate change impacts. The goods, works and services funded by the component will  be 
relatively modest during KAP II, and focus on public sector programs in Tarawa. They are likely to 
include: 
information materials
 on early climate warning and climate change; 
improved water management
 to 
protect wells and reduce piping leakage; 
coastal management and protection, 
including mangrove replantation 
and protection of public infrastructure; 
strengthened regulations
,
particularly on coastal aggregates removal, 
infrastructure zonation, and fisheries;  
population settlement planning; 
and 
waste management 
in vulnerable 
areas.  The process for prioritization of these investments is  on-going and is expected to be concluded 
by January 2005.  
 
·
Component 2.    Pilot Island Adaptation (US$0.2 million).  
This component would fund 
community adaptation 
investments
 in two selected outer islands, in order to engage local communities in the adaptation process, 
and test a whole-island approach to adaptation planning.  It would fund small grants provided directly to 
communities for integrated activities which they could do themselves with little outside help, identified 
through participatory planning. 
 
·
Component 3.    National Consultation and Mainstreaming (US$0.4 million).  
This component would 
consolidate the mainstreaming and adaptation process initiated under KAP I and prepare the expansion 
phase (KAP III) of the program.  It is expected to include:  technical assistance for continued 
mainstreaming of adaptation priorities
 into national and sectoral planning processes; 
local consultations
 on outer 
islands not included in Component 2, to prepare for the expansion phase; 
national consultations
 and 
workshops to continue to inform the mainstreaming of adaptation priorities into government 
operations; and 
awareness campaigns. 
 
·
Component 4.  Program Management and Capacity Building (US$0.7 million).  
This component would provide 
overall support to the project.  It would include:  
workshops and training
 to raise capacity in adaptation-
related areas; 
studies
 on the technical, social and economic analysis of vulnerability and adaptation 
options in priority sectors and islands (to advise the adaptation process and prepare for the expansion 
phase); and 
project management support
,
including technical assistance, facilitators for the island pilots, and 
incremental operating costs. 
 
Through the experience acquired in the pilot investments, and the awareness, consultation, and 
mainstreaming processes of Component 2, the project is expected to help modify adaptation practices and 
behaviors in two key ways: (a) directly, by helping people cope more effectively with vulnerability and change; 
and (b) indirectly, through a process that is expected to contribute to further inclusiveness of traditional 
governance structures into national economic planning.
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project would take place in the Republic of Kiribati, an extremely isolated nation of 93,000 inhabitants 
spread over 33 islands covering an area of ocean 2,000 km north to south and 4,000 km east to west.  As a 
country consisting primarily of small coral atolls, Kiribati is one of the countries most threatened by rising sea 
levels and climate change.   In the absence of adaptation measures, a recent Bank-funded study estimated that 
Kiribati could suffer damages equivalent to 17 to 34 percent of the 1998 GDP.   The main impacts are likely 
to be periodic inundation of atoll islands due to rising sea levels (compounded by storm surges), health and 
agriculture impacts due to more intense droughts and floods, and loss of revenue from offshore fisheries as 
tuna stocks move westward.  The proposed project would help the Government of Kiribati in adopting risk 
minimization strategies and prioritizing adaptation options to handle climate change impacts.   
 
There are no particular critical natural habitats in Kiribati;  however, the atoll systems are naturally fragile. 
Given the extreme isolation of the outer islands, traditional systems of decision making remain  important.

T
he lack of freshwater in many outer islands and job opportunities is exacerbating problems of overcrowding 
in the main islands of Tarawa and Kiritimati (Christmas). 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management 
 
E.1
\03
Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts 
 
Environmental impacts of the project are expected to be small, as the main intent is to mitigate potential 
negative impacts resulting from climate change.  There may be some small scale construction associated with 
the project, but this is not expected to have major negative environmental consequences. 
 
The major social issue that Kiribati will need to consider in the long term is whether sea level rise warrants 
population evacuation or shifts in settlement patterns for specific atolls or areas that might become partially 
or fully submerged as a result of climate change.  At present, the Government is considering incentives to 
attract population settlement to Kiritimati Island (where all land belongs to the Government).  Such 
settlement would be voluntary and dependent on the attractiveness of Kiritimati as a new growth center – an 
issue which will be studied under a proposed Technical Assistance Grant from the Asian Development Bank. 
 
Population relocation within Kiribati (and possible migration to neighboring countries) is a long term 
solution, and will very likely fall outside the lifetime and scope of KAP II  – however, the project would help 
identify areas of high vulnerability to coastal populations, strengthen population policies, and stimulate a 
national debate on adaptation options which would include relocation or emigration of parts of the 
population.  In the unlikely case that population relocation would need to be considered during the project 
(due to a major disaster), the provisions of a Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework, to be 
developed under the project, would apply. 
 
Within the life of the project, the main social issues include possible land acquisition and resettlement 
concerns  arising from the need to relocate infrastructure or housing away from vulnerable areas and  
conflicts which might arise when communities adopt adaptation options affecting others.   These would 
similarly be addressed through the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework.  
 
In cases where public programs funded under the project during the implementation phase might cause social 
impacts, they would be assessed and appropriate mitigation measures determined and implemented.  The 
process of decision-making in adaptation has already progressed considerably under the preparation phase of 
the project through a series of comprehensive national and local consultations and the achievement of a 
national consensus on the prioritization of adaptation options.  A social assessment has been conducted 
which has identified the major areas of vulnerability on different kinds of islands (atoll and non-atoll, islands 
in different climatic zones, etc.) and potential adaptive strategies to address those vulnerabilities.  The social 
assessment has also identified decisionmaking mechanisms at the local, island and national levels which can 
be used to address, 
inter alia
,
safeguards issues.   
 
E.2 
Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area. 
 
No negative impacts anticipated 
 
Page  4
E
.3 
Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
The main alternative scenario considered was to work exclusively with the Ministry of Environment, Land 
and Agriculture Development.  However, this was rejected as it would not promote mainstreaming of 
adaptation strategies into overall development planning in the country.  Instead, the project is expected to be 
coordinated by the Office of the President, and involve key sectoral Ministries involved in adaptation 
(Environment, Lands and Agriculture Development; Public Works and Utilities; Fisheries and Marine 
Resources Development; Internal and Social Affairs; and Ministry of Line and Phoenix Islands 
Development).  
 
E.4 
Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
A. Environmental Assessment 
 
An Environmental Analysis will be conducted during preparation which will (i) identify the potential 
environmental impacts of the national adaptation investments and propose appropriate mitigation solutions; 
(ii) identify the procedures for conducting an environmental screening of sub-grants under the Pilot 
Adaptation Component; (iii) describe the monitoring system to be put in place to evaluate the potential 
environmental impact of the investments; and (iv) identify and describe the capacity building efforts to allow 
for proper environmental monitoring in compliance with Government of Kiribati (GOK) and World Bank’s 
EA requirements and procedures.  Criteria for adaptation investments to be funded during KAP II would 
exclude those with significant environmental impacts (as this is a leading cause of island vulnerability). 
 
B. Involuntary 
Resettlement 
 
A
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework will be drafted which will form the basis of 
agreement with government concerning approaches to be taken in the event land acquisition and/or 
resettlement becomes necessary during the project implementation. The approach taken during the 
preparation phase of the project has ensured that the safeguard approaches are developed 
in the context of an 
overall adaptation strategy
 which make sense within the Kiribati context, are genuinely “owned” by the I-Kiribati, 
while at the same time meeting Bank requirements. 
 
E.5 
Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders are the people of Kiribati, including those at the community level on individual islands 
(the 
unimanwe
,
or councils of elders, church groups, women’s groups, youth groups, etc.), island-level bodies 
such as Island Councils and councils of churches, and national level bodies including government, civil 
society, the private sector.  The Adaptation Steering Committee includes the Chairman of the Kiribati 
Association of NGOs (KANGO), the Chamber of Commerce (representing the private sector), as well as 
government officials from key ministries and agencies. The preparation phase of the project included an 
iterative process of national and local workshops in key islands designed to stir national debate and consensus 
on adaptation options, and how to best mainstream them into national programs, including Ministry 
Operational Plans (MOPs) and the National Development Strategy.   This process has institutionalized 
expectations of regular exchanges of information, opinions and concerns among all levels of Kiribati society.   
 
The EA and Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework will detail mechanisms for dealing with 
environmental or social impacts of the project, including ongoing consultation strategies, grievance 
procedures, and participation in decision making processes.

Comments
:
The project is not expected to have significant environmental impacts, as it favors 'no regrets'  
environmental management measures to diminish island vulnerability.  However, there may be cases where 
the best adaptation option may be structural solutions or infrastructure set-backs away from the coast to 
minimize exposure to storms.   The environmental analysis would identify potential impacts and propose 
appropriate mitigation measures.
