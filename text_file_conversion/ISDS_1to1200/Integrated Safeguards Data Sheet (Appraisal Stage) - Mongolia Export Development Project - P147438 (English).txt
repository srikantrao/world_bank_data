                         Component 1: Development of a new line of export finance products ($10.74 million). This
                         component will provide financial, technical, and institutional development support to the
                         Agricultural Reinsurance Joint Stock Company (AgRe) in building a new line of export finance
                         products. It will enable AgRe to obtain knowledge on and develop a range of export credit insurance
                         and other trade finance products and its to-be-established Export Insurance Subsidiary (EIS) to start
                         providing export credit insurance products to Mongolian SMEs in the non-minerals sector. As an
                         additional outcome from this component, the EIS will become a center of excellence on export credit
                         insurance and other trade finance products and will provide training and consulting services to
                         insurance companies, financial institutions and exporting companies. This component will have two
                         parts:

                            Sub-component 1.1: Knowledge transfer and capacity building for the Agricultural Reinsurance
                         Joint Stock Company (AgRe) ($1.0 million). This sub-component will finance staff of AgRe working
                         on export finance instruments to go on short term (1- 6 months) fact-finding and study visits to solid
                         foreign partner/s (to be determined jointly by AgRe and WB) for on-site learning related to export
                         credit insurance and other trade finance development. The sub-component will also allow partner
                         institutions management and staff to visit AgRe for knowledge sharing sessions and bring in a
                         resident advisor, as needed. It will allow AgRe to draw on the expertise and experience of
                         consultants and relevant partners in developing a range of export credit insurance and other trade
                         finance products to Mongolian SMEs engaged in export activities. Once AgRe has developed the
                         export credit insurance product line, it will obtain a license and establish its Export Insurance
                         Subsidiary that will start providing export credit insurance products in Mongolia.

                             Sub-component 1.2: Equity injections to AgRe Export Insurance Subsidiary ($9.74 million) will
                         back up export insurance policies issued to Mongolian exporters either directly or through the private

                         insurance companies and other financial institutions. Equity injections to the to-be-established export
                         insurance subsidiary will be made available gradually over time, in three tranches and linked to the
                         premium volume.

                         Component 2: Export competitiveness enhancement ($8.5 million). This component will provide
                         funding for (i) export-related training programs and (ii) matching grants which would support
                         various expenditures by exporters directed at enhancing competitiveness of individual companies in
                         global markets. This component will have 2 sub-components:

                             Sub-component 2.1: Training and research on foreign trade ($2.5 million). This sub-component
                         will augment existing public and private sector-provided training programs to all Mongolian
                         entrepreneurs interested in starting or increasing exports. It will systematize such training, expand its
                         modules, sectoral depth, geographical coverage, virtual outreach, and will train individual exporters,
                         trainers, policymakers and public sector officials, and Mongolian diplomatic corps responsible for
                         economic representation of Mongolia abroad. The sub-component will also finance export-related
                         sectoral and analyses and other research which would benefit specific export-oriented industries or
                         other groups of exporters.

                           Sub-component 2.2: Matching grants to promote export competitiveness ($6.0 million). This sub-
                         component will provide matching grants for exporting Mongolian SMEs in the non-minerals sectors


                                                                       Page 2 of 9
                         to enhance their competitiveness. Costs eligible for financing under the sub-component would
                         include tailored consulting services and associated travel expenses of Mongolian exporters, including
                         acquisition of ISO and other internationally recognized quality certificates.

                         Component 3: Project Implementation Support ($1.54 million). The existing Project Implementation
                         Unit (PIU) responsible for the Multi-Sectoral Technical Assistance Project (MSTAP) will provide its
                         services for this Export Development Project. This is an experienced PIU that will ensure compliance
                         with the Bank procurement, disbursement, and financial management policies and procedures. The
                         PIU will be dissolved at project closing, with the technical skills for long-term sustainability of
                         operations developed and residing at the MOF and AgRe.

                         The project beneficiaries are limited to the non-mining SMEs sector, in order to support the export
                         diversification agenda. SMEs as defined in the Mongolia SME Law (e.g. the criteria varying by
                         sector: industry, retail trade: maximum 199 employees and maximum turnover of MNT1.5 billion;

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:


                                                                     Page 4 of 9
                           The project is classified as a FI project. It will reach individual companies through Sub-
                           Component 1.2 (AGRE export insurance subsidiary) and Component 2. The project will not have
                           direct investment to construct, expand, rehabilitate or modernize existing facilities used for the

                           production of export products. However, it will lead to provision of export credit insurance
                           products for the benefit of Mongolian exporters, as well as provide matching grants to exporters.
                           Although the types of concrete activities supported have yet to be identified, these activities may
                           have environmental and social impacts. Safeguards policies triggered include Environmental
                           Assessment, Indigenous Peoples, and Involuntary Resettlement. Given that the activities to be
                           financed by the project will only be known during implementation, a precautionary approach was
                           taken by triggering Natural Habitats (OP4.04), and Forests(OP4.36) to ensure that any activity
                           proposed for financing will be screened for impacts and/or benefits on natural habitats and forests.
                           Specific activities to be supported will be screened and due diligence will be carried out to assess
                           in terms of their potential environmental and social impacts and be categorized either as a
                           Category A, B or C. It is not likely that there will be Category A activities supported under the
                           Project given the type and size of SMEs eligible to benefit from the financial products being
                           offered under the Project. However, Category A activities will be considered based upon certain
                           eligibility criteria which will include capacity to manage safeguards risks and impacts. Particular
                           attention will be paid on the environmental and social risk profile of the export-oriented operations
                           of beneficiary companies. Any potential impact is expected to be confined and managed within the
                           areas of operation of individual exporting companies. No large scale, significant or irreversible
                           impacts are expected.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           The project will cover the entire country, whereby exporting companies from any part of Mongolia
                           will be able to benefit from the Project. Any indirect impacts from future activities of the exporters
                           are expected to be localized in their area of operation. No negative Project-influenced long term
                           impacts are expected.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse

                           impacts.
                           n/a
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The Borrower has developed an Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF). The
                           ESMF provides screening procedures. Key steps include due diligence, screening, safeguard
                           documentation, public consultation and disclosure, review and approval, and legal/contractual
                           obligation, and monitoring and reporting. The ESMF also includes eligibility criteria and
                           procedures for carrying out due diligence of potential environmental and social risks and impacts
                           and developing measures to address impacts.

                           The MOF will be responsible for the implementation of the project, including overall coordination,
                           results monitoring and communicating with the World Bank on all fiduciary and safeguard
                           aspects. It will be supported by an existing Project Implementation Unit (PIU) responsible for
                           MSTAP. AGRE will carry day-to-day implementation of Component 1 of the Project with strong
                           collaboration with PIU. The MOF PIU will communicate with the World Bank on all issues
                           (including safeguards issues) related to the Project, and implement all components excluding sub-
                           component 1.2. The MOF and the AGRE will responsible for implementing the ESMF. The
                           AGRE and MOF staff or consultants appointed would need to be trained in order to successfully


                                                                      Page 5 of 9
                           implement the ESMF. There would also be safeguard transaction costs for exporters to comply.
                           The implementing entities will assign dedicated staff to get trained and then support Project
                           implementation.

                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           Key stakeholders in terms of safeguard policies are the MOF, the Agricultural Reinsurance Joint
                           Stock Company, the Mongolian exporters and various business associations, and Mongolian
                           citizens affected by the exporters' activities.

                           The consultation with relevant stakeholders (including NGOs) on the ESMF was taken in 2014
                           and March 2016. The ESMF was locally disclosed on February 28, 2014 and the updated ESMF
