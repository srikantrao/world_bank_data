B.  Project Objectives 
The overall development ob
jectives of the proposed project are to: (a) Alleviate bottlenecks to economic 
growth constituted by power shortages; (b) continue financial and physical rehabilitation and restructuring 
of the power sector; and, (c) assist the GoR in developing and implem
enting strategies for Lake Kivu gas 
development, expanding commercially viable access to modern energy, and efficient management of 
biofuels resources.
C.  Project Description 
New generation capacity
: The new diesel capacity under order will cover the im
mediate need to eliminate 
the energy deficit of about 80 GWh per year. However, these high
-
speed diesels are not suitable for 
extended baseload generation, nor sufficient to cover load growth (at least 7% per year, even after taking 
into account efficiency
 improvements, load management programs, and the effects of tariff increases and 
fuel surcharge). Therefore, the project will finance approximately 15MW of new generation (probably 
dual
-
fuel, slow or medium
-
speed diesels) to fill the gap until the next hyd
ro or gas
-
based generation plant 
comes on line (after which the diesels can be used for peaking and backup, protecting against 
emergencies such as today’s).

Network rehabilitation
: The project will finance the refurbishment of substations and associated 
transmission equipment to cut energy losses and facilitate additional power imports from DRC and 
Uganda, in addition to critical distribution and metering investments.
TA and capacity building
. The project would cover institutional strengthening activitie
s in the Ministry of 
Infrastructure 
–
 which is also responsible for urban water supplies by Electrogaz 
–
 for Kivu gas 
development, design of low
-
cost rural electrification schemes (both on and off
-
grid) and drafting of new 
electricity and gas laws. For Ele
ctrogaz, it would include implementation of a comprehensive human 
resource development plan (required to be prepared under the ongoing management contract), feasibility 
studies for future projects, and assistance with negotiating independent power contract
s. Specific needs 
for technical assistance for the design and operation of rural electrification and biofuels management 
programs have been identified and may be co
-
financed by the GEF. 
D.  Project location (if known)

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
The Rwandan National Environment Policy (October 2003) s
ets out overall and specific objective as well 
as fundamental principles for improved management of the environment, both at the central and local 
levels, in accordance with the current policy of decentralization and good governance in our country. The 
pol
icy sets out institutional and legal reforms with a view to providing the country with a coherent and 
harmonious framework for coordination of sectoral and cross
-
cutting policies. It called for the 
Establishment of the Rwanda Environment Management Authori
ty (REMA) and the provincial, district 
and lower level committees responsible for environmental protection. The policy recognizes that 
Environment as a sector, is a new concept in Rwanda requiring true awareness and coordination of 
actions at all levels.
Currently the Environment Bill is before parliament, which when passed will lay the legal framework for 
environmental management in Rwanda. 
The main institutions with responsibility for the environment are the Ministry of Lands, Environment, 
Forestry, Wa
ter and Natural Resources (MINITERE) and Rwanda Environmental Management Authority 
(REMA), the latter which has recently been established. Within the MINITERE is the Directorate of 
Environment which is broadly responsible for policy issues, the budget and 
for monitoring policy 
implementation, whereas REMA is the technical arm of the MINTERE responsible for implementing the 
environment policy.
At local level, the District is an autonomous decentralized administrative structure with a legal status and 
finan
cial autonomy, with two principal political  bodies:
(a)
The District Council 
–
 is responsible to enforce the laws of Rwanda, promote governance 
based  on  democracy,  prepare  regulations  governing  the  District,  implement  Government 
decisions, to adopt the devel
opment action plan of the district, to adopt the district budget and 
to fix the maximum amount to release fro the District’s funds, to follow up the activities of 
the Executive Committee, to coordinate activities of the sectors, to approve grants, bequest 
and credits that the District may receive, inter alia. 
Page  3
(b)
The Executive Committee 
–
 is responsible for administration of the District, preparation of 
the District Development Action Plan, implementation of the district budget, preparation of 
quarterly  and  ye
arly  reports,  examination  and resolution  of  problems  that  could  not find 
solutions at the level of the Sector, inter alia.
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Applicable?
Safeguard Policy
If Applicable, How Might It Apply?
[y]
Environmental Assessment
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.01)  
OP 4.01
applies because the proposed 
program will finance investments in power generation, and distribution, to urban and 
rural communities. The location of th
e sites where investments will be located will be 
determined  during    program  implementation.  Therefore,  the  GoR  is  preparing  an 
Environmental 
and 
Social 
Management 
Framework 
(ESMF) 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
environmental and social issues associated with this pro
ject are adequately analyzed and 
understood,  and  that  all  associated  adverse  impacts  are  captured  through  screening, 
effectively mitigated and monitored. The ESMF will be sent to the Bank for review and 
clearance before it is disclosed publicly in Rwanda.
[n]
Natural Habitats
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.04) 
The project investments will be: i) a generation 
station within or in close proximity of 
Kigali, and ii) refurbishment and minor extension 
of the medium and low
-
voltage electricity network.  These will be primarily along 
roadways and are unlikely to impinge on areas formed largely by native plant and animal 
species, or where human activity has
 not essentially modified the areas primary 
ecological functions.  Therefore, the project is unlikely to trigger this policy.  Even so, 
provisions for compliance will be included in the ESMF to ensure that any possible 
triggering of the policy would be han
dled properly.
[n]
Pest Management
 (
OP 4.09
) N/A
[y]
Involuntary Resettlement
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.12) 
In most cases program activit
ies will be so 
designed and routed that this policy will not be triggered. However, for the few cases that 
may trigger it, the GoR is also preparing a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) , to 
ensure that the needs of those who are affected by the land acqu
isition needs of the 
program  activities,  loss  of  assets  and/or  access  to  their  individual  or  community 
economic, social and cultural resources, are addressed in such a manner that ensures their 
pre
-
program status is at least restored if not improved upon. 
The RPF will also address 
how those affected in this way will be consulted to ensure their meaningful and effective 
participation. The RPF will also be sent to the Bank for clearance and approval before it 
is disclosed publicly in Rwanda.
[n]
Indigenous Peoples
 (
OD 4.20
) 
This project will not in anyway affect the resource 
base of indigenous people, nor will opportunities for exclusion arise or their habitat and 
ecosystem be adversely impacted in anyway by this project.  Finally their traditional way 
of life
 (i.e their culture ) will also not be adversely affected by this project.
