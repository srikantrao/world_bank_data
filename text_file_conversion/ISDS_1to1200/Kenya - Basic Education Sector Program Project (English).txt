B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The project development objective is to assist the Government of Kenya in its 
implementation of the Kenya Education Sector Strategic Plan.  As part of the process of 
supporting and attaining the goals of the KESSP, the project development objectives from July 
2005 to June 2007 are: (i) to raise the net primary enrollment rate to at least 85 percent for boys 
and girls (baseline of  78 percent in Year 2003), and to raise the net primary enrollment rate in 
North-Eastern Province to 25 percent (baseline of  18 percent in Year 2003); (ii) to raise the 
primary completion rate to 65 percent (baseline of  57 percent in Year 2003); (iii) to increase the 
number of Form 1 secondary school places by 5 percent (baseline of 235,000 places in Year 
2003); (iv) to improve the efficiency of spending on education and the opportunity to learn at the 
basic level (by ensuring that the proportion of the overall education budget allocated to the 
primary sub-sector does not fall, that there is a sufficient allocation in the budget for non-salary 
operating costs, and that the unit cost of secondary education is reduced); and (v) to establish an 
agreed policy framework for the TIVET and higher education sub-sectors.
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Page  2
It is proposed that: (i) in the KESSP, the Government would increase the budgetary 
allocations for agreed, core, priority programs and activities; (ii) the Basic Education Sector 
Program (BESP) would support the KESSP through a Sector Investment Credit of $50 million; 
(iii) the financial support from IDA would be disbursed against actual spending on an agreed part 
and percentage of the Government’s education program in FY06 and FY07 (based on quarterly 
financial monitoring reports); and (iv) there would be scope for pooling of funds by other donors 
in an “education account”, assuming that there is (as expected) interest among other external 
agencies for supporting this approach. 
 
The total annual expenditure for the education core poverty programs is about K.Sh. 8 
billion (equivalent to about $100 million, compared to the total education budget of about $800 
million).  The list of core programs and the budgets for them would be updated and revised in the 
light of the ongoing MPER for the education sector (due to be completed in January 2005) and 
the finalization of the design of the KESSP.  It is expected that a substantial portion of the 
funding would be for items such as: 
 
·
an enhanced program of school construction and rehabilitation (targeted on the poorest 
parts of the country, including in the ASAL areas); 
·
per capita grants to primary schools for instructional materials; 
·
support for NGO and community schools in slum areas; 
·
expanded school health program (including de-worming of children); 
·
teacher in-service training program for existing primary teachers; 
·
reformed program of special education; 
·
scaling-up of the HIV education program in schools; and 
·
Secondary school bursaries targeted for poor children (and especially orphans). 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The KESSP is a nation-wide activity. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
There has not been a comprehensive environmental assessment of education issues in 
Kenya.  Currently as part of the KESSP preparation, the Ministry of Education, Science and 
Technology (MOEST) hired a consultant to assist the Government with a strategic plan for the 
development of school infrastructure (a draft report is available).  A number of key studies has 
been identified and would be carried out during the program design phase.  These key studies 
include School Water Sanitation Water Sanitation and Hygiene Assessment, Strategic 
Environmental Assessment and Strategic Social Assessment. 
 
It has been recommended that an Environmental and Social Management Framework and 
a
Resettlement Policy Framework be prepared, the Framework will be based on (i) key policy 
principles for environmental and social risk management; (ii) tools to screen activities for 
environmental and social impacts and mitigate such impacts; (iii) procedures to ensure that these 
principles and tools are appropriately applied; and (iv) guidelines for capacity building and 
monitoring.  The Framework assists the Government and its implementing agencies in screening 
Page  3
activities for likely environmental and social impacts, identifying documentation and preparation 
requirements through the application of standardized guidelines and codes of practice.

Environmental Assessment

BP
4.01)
 
The massive influx of children into 
school has created a wide range of problems for the Government.  It is estimated that 
maybe $6 million could be needed annually for new classrooms and other school 
infrastructure.  However, this estimate is far from being firm (better estimates will be 
available after a school mapping exercise has been completed).  A consultant has been 
hired to assist the Government with the design of a school infrastructure program, and 
this work will be reviewing all of the relevant social and environmental considerations.

Involuntary Resettlement
(
OP
/
BP
4.12) 
As noted earlier, the Government is 
working on a strategy for school infrastructure development.  There are constraints on 
constructing classrooms especially in the urban areas due to lack of land.  The new policy 
on school infrastructure development will need to address the possible issue of 
involuntary resettlement.
