A.2. Project Objectives
The objective of the project is to build an efficient and effective real estate cadastre and
registration system, contributing to the development of efficient land and real estate
markets. The focus of the project will be: (i) accelerating the establishment of the real
estate cadastre (REC) and the registration of rights; (ii) improving processes and
procedures through re-engineering of office functions and introducing automation and IT
technology to provide efficient registration services through the establishment,
implementation and monitoring of minimum service standards of property registration
transactions; (iii) improving the institutional capacity and human resources of SAGW
through the development and implementation of a strategic management plan and human
resources development plan; and (iv) developing the government's capacity to formulate

policies in order to achieve efficient property markets.

By 2009 the following are the expected outcome of the project: 1) the REC covers the
whole territory of Macedonia; 2) completed REC and registration of rights in urban and
peri-urban areas; 3) streamlined procedures for converting land cadastre to real estate
cadastre (conversion of possession rights to ownership rights) in rural areas; 4) all
transactions are registered in 1 day in all SAGW offices; 5) SAGW is self-financing and
operating according to modern business practices; 6) all cadastral surveying is done
through private surveyors; and 7) there is a well functioning mechanism in government to
formulate land policies.




A.3. Project Description

The project components are:

    a. Completing the Real Estate Cadastre This component will support the
        completion of real estate cadastre and registration of rights in urban and peri-
        urban areas in the country by 2010. The component will include three
        subcomponents: (i) operational support for completion of the REC, including
        base mapping, cadastral re-survey, support for systematic adjudication and
        registration of real rights, and rationalization of registration procedures; and (ii)
        public awareness campaign for REC (systematic registration).

    b. Institutional Development and Improving Service Delivery           The objective of this component is
        to transform SAGW into a modern and efficient national cadastre and registration agency, and
        improve service delivery of all local and regional offices with a goal to complete the registration
        of all transactions in 1 day by the end of the project. This component includes the following sub-
        components: (i) institutional development of SAGW which will focus on developing SAGW as
        an efficient and public service oriented agency with the goal of self-financing; (ii) promoting
        transparency and accountability through the issuance of "customer bill of rights", establishment
        of a hotline for customer complaints, and strengthening internal investigation of corruption and
        misconduct.; (iii) improving registration services for the public which will focus on SAGW local
        offices and customer service for secondary transactions; (iv) development of automated
        registration and cadastre system; and (v) education and training for SAGW staff as well as the
        nascent private sector surveyors.


    c. Development of Land Policy This component will support the government capacity to develop
        policies and regulatory framework to ensure completion of land and real estate cadastre and full
        functioning of land and real estate markets through: (i) the development of government capacity
        to coordinate the formulation of land and real estate policies through consultative processes; and
        (ii) studies and formulation of specific priority policies in the areas of: protection of ownership
        rights of registered land and real estate cadastre, regularization of informal settlements, access
        and fee structure of real estate cadastre information for other public and private entities, policies
        to promote the use of ownership and lease rights of rural land for collateral, land fragmentation,

        registration of illegal buildings, provision and access of land for investment, land use planning
        and development control policies, tax and fee structure for registration of property transaction.
        The component will also provide resources to drafting regulations once the policies are adopted.


    d. Project Management         The component will include: (i) support to SAGW to manage the project
        through financing the PMU expenses including contract staff; and (ii) monitoring and evaluation.




A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis:
As the goal of the project is to complete the real estate cadastre across the country with
the focus in the first two to three years on completing the urban and peri-urban areas.
Land cadastre will be converted in rural areas into Real Estate Cadastre once simplified
procedures are approved and adopted. This is expected to be done in the last two years of
the project.

B. Check Environmental Category A [ ], B [X ], C [ ], FI [ ]

Comments:

Though most of ECA land administration projects have historically been rated as
category C and no environmental impact assessment was required, the project will be
rated a low category "B" and a brief environmental management plan was prepared
during project preparation. A social assessment was prepared and a study on ethnic issues
and gender were also undertaken as part of project preparation.

Section II ­ Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

The principle environmental issues are: 1) potential construction/renovation of small
office buildings; 2) potential long term negative impact of registration of rights in the
absence of proper land use planning and control systems in place, especially in
environmentally sensitive areas. On the construction of buildings, the construction
contracts will include environmental guidelines to ensure adequate environmental
measures are employed during construction. On the issue of potential impact on land use,
the project will finance, under the land policy component, a study on the land use and
development control policies in Macedonia. Registration of rights in forest and other
protected areas will only be done once management plans are discussed and agreements
reached between the occupants and government agencies.




D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area.

None.



D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)

Registration of ownership rights for private forest were considered. However, during
preparation, it was clear that registration of rights without management plans are in place
could cause non sustainable use for forest. Therefore, it was agreed that registration of
rights in forest and other environmental sensitive areas would only be done after
management plans are discussed and agreed between the beneficiaries and the relevant
government institution.

To protect the rights of informal settlers, including the Roma communities, the project will ensure that:
where buildings or dwellings have been constructed or occupied otherwise than in accordance with
applicable laws or regulations of the Borrower: (a) the Borrower shall only record the buildings or
dwellings in the REC, and shall not register any ownership rights over the relevant land, unless and until;
(b) such buildings or dwellings have been regularized in accordance with such applicable laws or
regulations, in which case ownership rights over the buildings or dwellings, and the relevant land, shall be
registered by the Borrower in the REC upon application of the occupier and fulfillment of the
conditions prescribed by such laws or regulations.



D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

Registration of rights in and around forest and other environmental sensitive areas will be
coordinate with the ministry of environment and ministry of agriculture and forestry to
ensure that management plans are in place. Registration of ownership rights of properties
of cultural heritage significance will be coordinated with the Ministry of Culture and the
Agency for the Protection of Cultural Properties.




D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Consultations are planned with the key stakeholders on the safeguard issues in
November, 2004 before the arrival of the appraisal mission.
