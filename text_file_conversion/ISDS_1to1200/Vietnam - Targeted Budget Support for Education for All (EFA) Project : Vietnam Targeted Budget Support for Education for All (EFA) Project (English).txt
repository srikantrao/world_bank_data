A.2. Project Objectives 
The project will contribute towards the achievement of the National EFA Action Plan 
goals by providing targeted budgetary support through the National Targeted Program 
(NTP) disbursement channel.   The project will support the Government of Vietnam to 
make progress towards 
the improvement of education service delivery through the 
implementation of minimum quality standards, known as Fundamental School Quality 
Levels (FQSL) in the primary subsector
.
During the life of the project, the share of 
schools achieving these minimum education quality inputs will increase.  In addition, the 
project will also promote an overarching 
policy framework in education finance, planning 
and governance that will act as an enabling environment 
for improved service delivery.   
A.3. Project Description 
There are two project components.  Component 1 strives to support the implementation 
of FSQL standards by channeling official development assistance into the Education 
National Targeted Program.  Component 2 provides technical assistance and capacity 
building to strengthen the administration, implementation and evaluation of the 
Education NTP. 
Page  2
Project beneficiaries will be children attending schools being upgraded to FSQL and out-
of-school children who will be drawn into the education system through NTP 
interventions.  Activities are targeted to disadvantaged groups or areas, hence the 
beneficiary group will contain a higher proportion of poor children and ethnic minorities 
than the population of Vietnam in general.  In the long term, improvements in educational 
outcomes are presumed to flow from the better input package.   
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The project will be implemented nationwide.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
The project will have no significant environmental impact.  School construction under the 
project will be limited to classroom upgrading and rehabilitation work.  The Ministry of 
Construction has established guidelines for construction bid specifications to cover 
eventualities regarding construction dust and noise control, waste management, site 
management, sanitation facilities and asbestos containing material demolition 
management.  MoET must abide by these guidelines.   
Primary educational outcomes for ethnic minority children are well below the national average.  The 
project is expected to benefit districts/schools where ethnic minority people reside and will have a positive 
influence on the quality of primary education for ethnic minority children, for instance, through the 
promotion of Vietnamese language strengthening skills or vernacular language instruction.  Many ethnic 
minority children drop out early in their education because the language of instruction acts as a barrier. 
Improving access to and quality of education demands close contact and dialogue with parents, 
communities and local stakeholders, especially in ethnic minority areas.  The project will promote local 
participation and involvement through a variety of avenues, such as involvement of Parent-Teacher 
Associations in school planning and encouragement of local accountability through public dissemination of 
information on school performance and resource allocation.   
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Not applicable 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas.

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not applicable 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
As mentioned above, specific environmental protection clauses are already in existence 
and will be incorporated in all civil works contracts.  Community-participation will 
encourage accountability for results and transparency in the management of resources.  
The project will promote the collection of gender and ethnicity disaggregated data in 
order to build in equity considerations in primary education development plans as well as 
provide the basis for effective monitoring and evaluation processes. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Project preparation builds on a large consultation effort conducted during the design of 
the Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children project and the development of the 
FSQL principles.  The design of TBS was informed by eleven field visits and discussions 
with provincial representatives, district officers, teachers, principals, primary students 
and community members from urban, rural and remote areas.  Focus group discussions 
were held at school sites, while provincial consultation workshops were conducted to 
review the Government of Vietnam Pre-Feasibility and Feasibility reports.
