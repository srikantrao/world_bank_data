Repeater
project?
B. Project Objectives
The project development objective (PDO) is to improve delivery and utilization of quality essential
health services with a focus on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health
(RMNCAH) services in selected districts.
C. Project Description


﻿The proposed project comprises three components: a) support implementation of facility based
Results Based Financing (RBF) activities; b) support towards central level executed activities; and c)
support towards civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS). The objective of Component 1 is to
institutionalize and scale-up the implementation of facility based RBF activities with a view of
0
improving the delivery of RMNCAH services through frontline health facilities from both the public
and private sectors will be rewarded under performance contractual frameworks to increase the
quantity and quality of RMNCAH services. Component 2 is to strengthen institutional capacity to
deliver quality RMNCAH program activities and (ii) ensure RMNCAH service readiness of the
frontline service providers. This will entail supporting complementary central level activities aimed
at strengthening the capacity of the Ministry in implementing RMNCAH program activities, clinical
care, and quality assurance. Component 3 will support the GoU to improve the civil registration and
vital statistics system and activities supported by this component will be aligned to the Global Civil
Registration and Vital Statistics Scaling Up Investment Plan 2015-2024.
D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
The project will be implemented through existing health facilities and is not likely to require
acquisition of land and restriction of access to legally designated protected areas. However, since the
project may involve minor renovation works in health facilities whose exact location are not yet
known, the project could lead to acquisition of additional land and or loss of livelihoods of some
individuals or communities. Preliminary assessment therefore suggests that OP 4.12 will be
triggered. The interventions under the proposed project involve handling of medical products and
thus contribute to increased generation of medical waste in the health facilities, and therefore renders
the project to trigger OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. During project preparation, mitigation
measures shall be suggested as part of the project design. Furthermore, since specific project
facilities and sites are not yet known, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)
and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) shall be prepared to guide handling of project
environmental and social issues.
E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
0
The Ministry of Health has substantial experience with World Bank safeguards gained from
implementation of UHSSP (P115563). Environmental compliance is the responsibility of the
Environmental Health Division (EHD) of the Ministry of Health which is charged with executing the
National Health Care Waste Management Plan under the overall policy guidance of the National
Environment Management Authority. The National Health Care Waste Management Plan for
2009/2010 - 2011/2012 prepared and disclosed under the UHSSP will apply to this project, and will
therefore be updated and disclosed prior to Appraisal.
However, EHD has not fully participated in UHSSP. Their functionality and capacity to handle
environmental and social safeguards issues and requirements will therefore be assessed during
project preparation.
Overall social and environmental risk of the proposed project is rated moderate.

﻿II. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Safeguard Policies          Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment    Yes         The interventions under Component 1 of the
OP/BP 4.01                              proposed project involve handling of medical
products and thus contributes to increased generation
of medical waste in the health facilities, may involve
minor civil works (repairs and minor renovation
works) and relatedimpacts and therefore renders the
project to trigger OP 4.01 on Environmental
Assessment. Since the participating health facilities
are not yet determined or known, Environmental and
Social Management Framework shall be prepared to
guide management environmental and social aspects.
Once the specific sites and respective activities have
been identified, ESIA shall be undertaken and
ESMPs developed before start of any works. The
ESMF shall be prepared in a consultative manner and
disclosed both in-country by the client and at
Infoshop by IDA before project appraisal. Similarly
the existing National Health Care Waste
Management Plan for 2009/2010 - 2011/2012
prepared and disclosed under the UHSSP will apply
to this project, and will therefore be updated and
disclosed prior to Appraisal.
Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04  No          The project will not support any activities that may
affect natural habitats.
Forests OP/BP 4.36          No          The project is not anticipated to affect any segment
Q)                                               of forest/s and/or support activities associated with
forests.
Pest Management OP 4.09     No          The project will not support procurement or use of
pesticides.
Physical Cultural Resources  Yes        Though the project will be undertaken in existing
OP/BP 4.11                               facilities and with no known PCRs, the civil works
may affect unknown PCRs and a chance finds
procedure shall be developed as part of the ESMF.
Indigenous Peoples OP/BP    No          Even though the participating health facilities in this
4.10                                    project are not yet determined, none of the existing
facilities would be located in the specific areas
inhabited by indigenous peoples (1k, Bennet and
Batwa) in Uganda. However, under the social aspect
of OP4.01 the inclusion of all project beneficiaries /
service users would be addressed as part of the site
specific ESIA and /or ESMP.
Involuntary Resettlement OP/  Yes       The project interventions under Component 1 will be
BP 4.12                                 undertaken in existing health facilities and therefore


﻿there is likely no land-take/acquisition or loss of
livelihoods. However, since the specific facilities
(hospitals and HC-IVs) and scope of activities are
not known at this point, additional land may be
required in cases where expansion of the health
facility may be required, hence triggering OP 4.12
Involuntary Resettlement. Therefore a Resettlement
Policy Framework shall be prepared to guide
management of any arising land acquisition. The
RPF shall be prepared in a consultative manner and
disclosed both in-country by the client and at
Infoshop by IDA before project appraisal.
Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37    No           The project will not finance any dams or abstract
water from existing dams.
Projects on International    No           The project will not support any activities on
Waterways OP/BP 7.50                      international waterways.
Projects in Disputed Areas OP/ No         There are no known disputed areas in the likely
BP 7.60                                   project sites of the country.
