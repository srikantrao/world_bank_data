                           The development objective is to support the Government of Kiribati to prepare an Investment Plan for consideration
                           by the SREP for endorsement.

                           C. Project Description
                           The World Bank, in consultation with the Government of Kiribati, will commission a consultant to assist it to draft the
                           Scaling Up Renewable Energy Investment Plan. It is expected the Investment Plan will identify the renewable energy
                           technologies and projects that will contribute positively to the sustainable economic development of Kiribati and
                           supporting goals under the RPF. It will also outline the specific tasks that must be carried out to successfully deliver the
                           projects, identify the financing options for funding the projects, and identify the ways in which SREP can help to
                           leverage concessional and private sector financing.
