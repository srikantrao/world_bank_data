                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The project's development objective is to contribute to the implementation of the 2016 EITI standards and the
                           mainstreaming of EITI reporting.

                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed project will finance the following activities:

                                 1. Develop the procedures and infrastructure for contract and information disclosure (US$50,000).
                                    The project will support the National Secretariat to: (i) implement the Government disclosure policy,
                                    and document deviations in practice including their bases (compile an Excel file, including annexes
                                    and amendments to contracts); (ii) ensure that the EITI Chad website provides documents in
                                    searchable pdf, with easily identifiable connection to license/contract areas.

                                 2. Strengthen the communication and dissemination effectiveness of the EITI national secretariat
                                    (US$90,000). The project will finance: (i) the preparation of stakeholders mapping to identify
                                    constituencies, focusing on civil society; (ii) the identification of effective communication channels
                                    and strategies; (iii) the effective dissemination of the 2016 EITI report; and (iv) the identification and
                                    use of communication effectiveness indicators.
                                 3. Strengthen the national secretariat's administrative processes and internal controls (US$210,000).
                                    The project will finance (i) the implementation, and to the extent possible, the automation of internal
                                    administrative processes and procedures; (ii) the development and implementation of a monitoring
                                    and results framework, to accompany the planned decrease in administrative cost (currently
                                    70 percent of total cost) and increase in activity implementation ratio (currently 47 percent of total
                                    cost).
                                 4. Mainstream the collection and reporting of government extractive revenue for EITI purposes
                                    (US$50,000). The project will finance a scoping study to identify efficient institutional arrangements

                                    for the collection and reporting of government revenue under EITI, and the extent of possible
                                    automation in the production of information and supporting documentation. The findings will inform
                                    the design of reporting templates, to be implemented as part of the information systems upgrade
                                    (Customs' ASYCUDA, the Tax Department's SIGTAS, and the national oil company's SIG) supported by
                                    the Domestic Resource Mobilization and Management project.
                                 5. Project management (US$20,000). Financial management and procurement for this grant will be
                                    carried out by ST-PAMFIP an existing and functioning Project Implementation Unit (PIU) on behalf of
                                    the EITI National Permanent Secretariat. The project will cover additional administrative costs to be
                                    incurred by the PIU to undertake these activities, including project audits.

                           Project activities may be adjusted during implementation if necessary to reflect new priorities that
                           might arise from the EITI independent validation process, expected to be completed in October 2018.

                          analysis (if known)
                          The project is identified under Safeguards Category C, implying that the environmental and social impacts are
                          not anticipated. The grant will not finance studies or assessments linked to potential mineral extraction, and
                          none of the project activities have direct or indirect impact on the environment. Most project activities are
                          expected to be located in N'Djamena, and are not anticipated to trigger any World Bank safeguard policy.
                          Awareness campaigns may be rolled out across the country.

                          The Ministry of Petroleum and Energy and the Ministry of Environment have a long history of monitoring and
                          enforcing environmental and social performance of operators in the extractive industries. Notwithstanding,
                          high staff turn-over and limited resources mean that capacities at both ministries are moderate. On the other
                          hand, the EITI Permanent National Secretariat has considerable experience in the area of public consultation,
                          social inclusion and outreach developed over the past 11 years of participation in the EITI process.
