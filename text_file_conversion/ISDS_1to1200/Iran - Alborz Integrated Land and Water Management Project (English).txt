B.   Project Objective 
The development objective of the proposed project is to enhance current government efforts to 
achieve sustainable integrated land and water management at the river basin level through: (i) 
increasing agriculture productivity through the improved irrigation and drainage system and 
participatory management mechanism; (ii) reducing soil erosion and sediment yields into the 
Alborz Dam, which is under construction using GOI funds, through the improved upper watershed 
management; and (iii) protecting the water environment downstream of the Babol River and other 
water bodies through the improved hydrological / water quality monitoring, reservoir operation, 
and pest management.   
The project will enable water resources in the Alborz River basin to be managed in a sustainable 
manner by addressing the concerns described above.  Improving management of arable and 
rangeland in the catchment area of the Alborz Dam (currently under construction with funding 
from the Government of Iran) will reduce the risks of siltation from watershed degradation. 
Benefits will accrue to all stakeholders in rural and urban areas.  The primary beneficiaries are 
farmers, livestock herders, urban residents and forest dwellers.  By including users from farm-level 
Water Users Associations (WUAs) and micro-catchment level watershed management/forest 
cooperatives, the project will support decision making on water resources management down to the 
lowest appropriate levels.  A comprehensive river basin management approach will facilitate 
solutions to basin-level water allocation and water quality problems, leading eventually to better 
Page  2
natural resource management and conservation.  This will provide valuable lessons for replication 
in other river basins of the country. 
C.  Project Description 
The project envisages the following components:  
1.  
Upper Watershed and Forestry Management (US$13 million): 
This will include: (a) technical 
assistance, master planning and capacity building in the upper watershed; (b) forest and 
rangeland rehabilitation and management (51,500 ha); and (c) soil and water protection 
measures over the upper watershed area.  In the alpine rangeland and forest areas, overgrazing 
and illegal timber cutting have caused serious pasture and forest degradation, which has led to 
increased soil erosion and sediment yields downstream.  The component aims at establishing 
effective soil and water protection measures and improving sustainable and participatory 
community-based forest and rangeland management including the establishment of 
cooperatives in the upper watershed;  
2. 
Irrigation and Drainage Management (US$130 million):  
This will include:  (a) rehabilitation 
and construction of irrigation and drainage systems covering a total area of about 52,000 ha, of 
which 33,000 ha are traditional irrigation areas and 19,000 ha are new irrigation areas 
(currently being irrigated by ground and rain water); (b) capacity building and technical 
assistance for establishment of WUAs and their increased O&M/cost recovery function; and  
(c) agricultural extension and research activities to support farmers for improved water 
management and crop diversification.  The component aims to enhance irrigation water use 
efficiency and agriculture production/income by rehabilitation and modernization of the 
irrigation/drainage systems and improved O&M through development of participatory water 
management including training and agriculture extension/research support;  
3. 
Integrated Basin Water Management (US$7.0 million):
 
This comprises:  (a) establishment of 
a
Basin Water Committee (BWC) and Basin Water Fund (BWF); and (b) establishment of a 
GIS-based information dissemination and optimized water distribution system on a basin scale:  
 
-
The former sub-component will include:  (i) establishment and technical support for the 
BWC, comprising the key stakeholders, including: Regional Water Authority of 
Mazandaran and Golestan (RWAMG); Mazandaran Jehad-e Agricultural Organization 
(MJAO); and end user representatives; (ii) establishment of the BWF to provide WUAs, 
forestry cooperatives, and other communities and informal groups with support for 
community-based land and water conservation and income generating activities under the 
guidance of the BWC.  This sub-component aims to support both integrated land/water 
resources management on a basin scale and community-based initiatives for improved 
land/water resources management. 
 
-
The latter sub-component includes: (i) technical assistance for detailed studies and system 
development; (ii) capacity building and training of the core management unit within the 
RWAMG and associated entities; and (iii) provision of monitoring equipment and 
decision-making tools.  This sub-component aims to enhance inter-sectoral coordination 
through the GIS-based system and the optimized water distribution system on a basin scale 
and enable distribution of stored water to farming areas in the most efficient manner.  
4. 
Environment Management (US$8.0 million):  
This pertains to the implementation of the 
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) of the Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA), 
Page  3
including water quality monitoring, integrated pest management, and other mitigation 
measures.   
 
5. 
Project Implementation and Coordination Support
 (
US$4.0 million
): This involves:  
(i) project implementation and coordination support for the PMUs (Project Management Units) 
and PIUs (Project Implementation Units) and (ii) their monitoring and evaluation (M&E), 
reporting and auditing activities. 
 
Regarding institutional arrangements, community-
based WUAs based on Iran’s Cooperatives Law 
were successfully piloted at the farm level in the previous Irrigation Improvement Project.  This 
project will replicate WUAs up to the secondary level of the irrigation network.  In the previous 
Irrigation Improvement Project (IIP), Water Users Groups (WUGs) were established up to the 
tertiary and quarterly levels which would mean an area of approximately 300 ha.  This project aims 
to go a step higher and establish WUAs up to the secondary level which would cover a wider area 
(for instance 3,000 ha instead of 300) in all irrigated areas of the project.  Furthermore, the 
project’s team and the government are conducting an institutional analysis and preparing a 
mechanism to operationalize the BWC concept with adequate civil society participation by 
appraisal.  
Total base costs of the project are estimated at about US$163 million and total costs including 
physical/price contingencies are around US$216 million.  It is expected that the IBRD loan would 
be around US$140 million, with the remainder funded by Government counterpart financing and 
beneficiary contributions.  
D.  Project Location (if known) 
The project is located in the Alborz River basin of Mazandran Province, which drains into the 
Caspian Sea. 
E.  
Borrower’s Institutional Capacity 
The GOI has established a Central Liaison Office (CLO) comprised of the Ministry of Jihad and 
Agriculture (MOJA) and the Mazandaran Golestan Regional Water Company (MGRWC) 
representatives and two PIUs in Mazandaran. The CLO will be responsible for:  (i) overall project 
coordination and management; (ii) procurement and financial management; (iii) implementation of 
the EMP; and (iv) staff training, research and knowledge management.  The CLO will be guided by 
the Steering Committee for the project composed of the key representatives of the Ministry of 
Economics and Finance (MOEF), MOJA, MOE, the Management and Planning Organization 
(MPO), and other central government agencies. 
Project implementation will be handled by the PIUs of MGRWC and the MOJA.  The MOJA is 
responsible for work on both the upper watershed/forestry management component and the 
irrigation and drainage management component.  The MGRWC is responsible for the trunk 
drainage and irrigation component as well as overall water resources management. The 
Mazandaran Department of the Environment in DOE will supervise the implementation of the 
environmental management component in compliance with the EMP.  The two PIUs will need to 
have adequate implementation capacity and work in close coordination in order to ensure 
successful implementation.  
The BWC and BWF will be established in order to:  (i) facilitate inter-sectoral consultation on a 
basin scale; (ii) prepare a basin master plan and monitor its implementation and progress in 
Page  4
coordination with MOJA and MGRWC, as well as stakeholders within a basin; and (iii) provide 
direct support for WUAs, forestry cooperatives, and other communities and informal groups to help 
improve their land/water resources management and sustain their livelihood through income 
generating activities.  Technical assistance and outreach programs will be provided to empower 
WUAs, forestry cooperatives and the BWC to support community-based land and water 
management activities.   
 
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
The project includes in its area of influence the Alborz Dam (height = 78 meters), which is not 
financed by the project.  The dam and its reservoir area are currently under construction, under a 
separate project that is fully financed by the Government.  A separate environmental assessment 
report was previously prepared for the dam project, which has been approved by the Iranian 
Department of Environment (DOE).  
The present project, categorized as Category A under OP4.01, triggers seven (7) safeguard 
policies
—environment assessment, pest management, involuntary resettlement, forests, safety of 
dams, cultural property and projects on international waterways — for which mitigation measures 
will be undertaken as will be described in the Supplementary Environmental and Social 
Assessment (ESA) report that is under preparation by the Government.  
Project investment activities are planned in the forested upper watershed area that comprises the 
catchment area for the Alborz Dam.  The area downstream of the dam is a well developed 
agricultural plain that also will have investment activities.  Water quality and quantity will be 
monitored under the project, and community activities will be arranged for environmental 
improvements in both the upper and lower watersheds. 
Applicable?
Safeguard Policy 
If Applicable, How Might It Apply? 
[YES] 
Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01):
 
In order to take into account the new activities 
for the upper and lower watersheds as proposed under this project
,
additional work is being 
c
arried out to prepare a Supplementary Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) Report 
that will comply with all Bank Safeguard policies, including OP 4.01.
 
[NO] 
Natural Habitats (
OP
/
BP
4.04): 
As there are no critical natural habitats of inter
national 
significance affected by the project, or significant conversion of natural habitats, OP4.04 is 
not triggered. The cleared reservoir area for the dam comprises agricultural land and forest. 
Conservation of the upper forests and habitats is addresse
d
through the conservation and 
sustainable forest management activities of the upper watershed and forestry management 
component. 
[YES] 
Pest Management (
OP 4.09
): 
As this project will develop new irrigated agricultural areas 
and the use of pesticides is an existing issue, OP 4.09 is triggered. A project specific 
Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPM) is being prepared to addr
ess this policy and will be 
incorporated into the Supplementary ESA.
 
[YES] 
Involuntary Resettlement
 (
OP
/
BP
4.12): 
The ongoing construction of the Alborz Dam in 
the project site (financed by the government) has resulted in the displacement (i
n
process) 
of about 4000 people in 18 villages. The task team is in the process of reaching an 
agreement with the government regarding a course of action to retrofit the resettlement 
process for those that have already been compensated and relocated from t
he project area, 
so that the Resettlement Plan (RP) will be consistent with the provisions of OP 4.12 for all 
affected people. In addition, two of draft Resettlement Policy Frameworks (RPF) are being 
Page  5
prepared by the government for the potential land acquis
ition under the irrigation/drainage 
component (agricultural plain) and livestock reduction under the upper watershed and 
forestry management component.  
[NO] 
Indigenous Peoples (
OD 4.20
)
The ongoing social assessment has not indicated any data to 
trigger this policy. 
[YES] 
Forests (
OP
/
BP
4.36): 
The above mentioned Supplementary ESA Report will address this 
poli
cy and provide recommendations.  The policy is triggered as there are many small 
communities with a total of approximately 7000 people in the upper forested watershed 
actively using forest resources.  A forestry management plan will be prepared in a 
participatory manner to introduce sustainable forestry management practices.     
 
[YES] 
Safety of Dams (
OP
/
BP
4.37): 
An independent Panel of Experts (POE) has been 
constituted to oversee the preparation and implementation of the dam safety aspect.  
The 
POE met, carried out site visits, and submitted the dam safety report in February 2004.  Its 
recommendation has been incorporated in the Supplementary ESA Report.
 
[YES] 
Cultural Property (draft OP 4.11 - 
OPN 11.03
)
The existing environmental assessment 
report addressed cultural property in the dam site and upper watershed areas through a field 
based inspection and prior
review of the project by the Sari Cultural Heritage Organization.   
Several shrines (approximately 10) and tombs (approximately 6) are being protected from 
flooding by the reservoir. Chance find procedures were also used during the construction 
activities in the dam site area. 
 
For the downstream irrigation areas, the initial construction of some structures has started.  
Currently, the alignment of the irrigation structures is being designed to avoid cultural 
property sites identified by a field based inspection.  To conform with 
Iranian regulations, 
the conservation and buffer zone distances from cultural property sites must be respected 
during the construction activities.  The Supplementary ESA will review all actions carried 
out to date and ensure appropriate additional mitigation measures are implemented.

III. ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues and 
prepare to mitigate them? 
To address the multiple safeguard issues in this project, the task team initiated scoping and review 
of the major potential impacts in late 2002.  The environmental assessment prepared for the Alborz 
Dam project was reviewed, and site visits were conducted to the full project area.  Based on the 
Page  6
scoping, terms of reference for a Supplementary Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) 
study were discussed with the government, which is now underway.  Discussions between the 
Bank and the Government indicate that the Government is in the process of deciding on the 
approach to mitigate possible adverse impacts under OP 4.12 on people who have already received 
cash compensation under the dam project and have moved out of the project area, but may not have 
found sustainable livelihoods after resettlement.  The study area of the Supplementary ESA now 
under preparation includes the Alborz Dam, the upper watershed and the downstream areas where 
the irrigation works will be constructed. 
Given the multidisciplinary nature of the project, several Bank safeguard specialists are working 
with the Government to ensure compliance with the Bank’s safeguard policies, and this is being 
overseen by the MNA Regional Safeguards Adviser, with support from the Quality Assurance and 
Compliance Unit of the Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Network 
(ESDQC).  
B.   How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed? 
Initial consultations have already commenced in the project area on the potential impacts of the 
project, through a combination of interviews with farmers and other residents, and through 
meetings with technical specialists in the government agencies. A second set of public 
consultations was held in February 2004 during preparation of the Draft Supplementary ESA 
Report.  The Final Draft Supplementary ESA Executive Summary will be available in Farsi and 
disclosed at appropriate locations in Iran.  The draft Resettlement Plan and the draft Resettlement 
Policy Frameworks for the downstream irrigation area and the upper watershed area will also be 
disclosed in Farsi at appropriate locations in Iran. 
IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED ON SAFEGUARDS AT PCN REVIEW 
The project is classified as Category A in accordance with OP 4.01, and triggers seven safeguards 
policies.  During recent missions, the Regional Safeguards Advisor and the task team discussed 
with the Government the key requirements for the ESA Report in order to comply with the Bank's 
safeguards policies.  The Draft Supplementary ESA (including Executive Summary) will be 
disclosed prior to appraisal.  
Once the issues noted in the table in Section II are addressed, the project itself will lead to 
improvement in water resources management. 
 
Agreed Target Date for Quality Enhancement Review 
A
Quality Enhancement Review (QER) meeting to address issues related to safeguard policy issues 
is expected to be held in August 2004.
