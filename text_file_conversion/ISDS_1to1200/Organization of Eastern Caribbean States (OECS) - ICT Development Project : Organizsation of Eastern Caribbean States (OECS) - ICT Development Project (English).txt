B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project development objective is to improve the access and quality of telecommunications 
services and promote their productive use to generate economic benefits within the OECS 
region. The successful implementation of the project will allow consumers to receive better 
access and quality of telecommunication services at a lower cost. Supporting the development of 
business outsourcing services, enabled by information and communication technologies (ICT) 
will boost the local economies and achieve sustainable territorial and regional development. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
The proposed project focuses on a tailored set of interventions that build on the telecom sector 
reforms and complement existing initiatives aimed at improving tertiary-level ICT education, 
such as the Caribbean Knowledge and Learning Network. Based on this focus, the project will 
include the following three components: 
 
Strengthening the telecom and ICT sector’s policy, regulatory and legal framework.
   
Page  2
 
 
This component would include technical assistance support to: a) review the existing 
telecommunications laws, b) tariff rebalancing and affordability assessment based on market 
research, c) design a competition policy based on revisions to the legal framework, e) capacity 
building and implementation of a medium-term corporate plan for ECTEL, f) harmonize e-
commerce legislation and policy, g) develop a country-based ICT framework and regional e-
strategy, and h) extension of the spectrum management and control program for ECTEL. 
 
“Smart Subsidy” approach to provide universal access.   
This component will assist ECTEL to provide support to the NTRCs in the actual implementation 
of the output-based aid auction/tender process to select the successful private sector operator in 
each of the five countries to provide telecommunications services to the poor in un-served and 
underserved areas as well as Internet connectivity to public institutions (schools, training 
centers, public libraries and post offices)  
 
Support to Business-processes outsourcing services.   
This component would provide technical assistance support to a) review existing incentive 
packages tailored towards manufacturing and define incentives targeted to the contact center 
industry and IT-enabled services, b) review Intellectual Property Rights laws, c) assist ECTEL to 
establish rates for Outsourcers and assist Governments in negotiating preferential rates for 
Outsourcers with existing suppliers of telecommunications infrastructure, d) support business 
development, marketing and training for at least two cyberparks and/or call centers in the 
OECS, e) perform feasibility studies for at least two cyberparks and/or call centers in the OECS, 
and local business incubators to facilitate entrepreneurship in the ICT sector. 
 
The estimated project costs are $7.2 million, of which $3.2 million would be allocated to 
strengthening the telecom and ICT sector’s policy, regulatory and legal framework, $2.5 million 
to the “smart subsidy” approach to provide universal access, and $1.5 million to support the 
business process outsourcing services.

Comments: 
The LCSES – Quality Assurance Team (QAT) has reviewed the Project Concept Document 
(PCN) and Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS) for the above-mentioned project, which 
seeks to increase the rural access to telecommunications infrastructure, to improve the 
provision of basic telecommunication services, and to foster economic diversification by 
developing the ICT services sector.  We concur with a Category “C” rating and offer the 
following comments on the safeguards aspects of the project.  Please note that because of the 
limited information available at the PCN stage, these comments in no way limit the 
applicability of the safeguards to the project or the compliance work required.   
As explained in the Region’s 
Guidelines on Fiduciary and Safeguards Aspects in Investment 
Lending
, safeguards oversight at the Quality Enhancement Review (QER) and clearance at 
the Decision Meeting and Negotiations for this type of project is the responsibility of the line 
Sector Manager based, if necessary, on the advice of the qualified environmental and social 
development members of the task team.  It is the responsibility of the task team to alert QAT 
of any changes in project design or of any new information that could potentially require 
reclassification of the project as a Corporate Risk or Category “A” project.  As you move 
forward with preparation, we will be happy to provide further advice on safeguard policies 
and procedures, task team composition, and available resources. 
In accordance with the Bank’s Disclosure Policy, please ensure that, prior to the start of 
appraisal, (i) a copy of each necessary safeguard document (e.g., EA report, IPDP), PID, and 
PAD Stage ISDS signed by the Sector Manager are in the InfoShop in Washington, and (ii) 
copies of the necessary safeguard documents are available for local public review at one or 
more convenient locations.
