B.  Project Objectives 
 
The project will support the government’s five-year development plan for the period 2005-2009. The 
overall objective of this plan is to improve the health status of the population, notably for women and 
children while focusing efforts on reducing inequalities in health outcomes. The implementation of this 
plan will be embedded into the poverty reduction strategy the government elaborated in 2002 and which 
places achievement of MDGs at the center of its socio-economic program. Therefore, actions and 
programs supported under this project will have a strong poverty focus.   
The proposed project is conceived as a Swap (i.e donors and government interventions are articulated 
around a health strategy and supporting expenditure framework; joint annual reviews of sector 
performance and action plans are conducted, in line with agreed upon indicators) will focus on addressing 
major bottlenecks, which prevent achievement of MDGs, and will support MOH’s effort primarily in the 
following areas: (a) improvement in equitable access to basic and quality health services by the poor; (b) 
adequate financing of the sector to provide equitable allocation of resources and increase financial access 
of the poor to services; (c) implementation of a sound human resources strategy; (d) improvement of 
capacity for overall sector management and organization of both health and administrative services at 
different level of the health system in order to ensure that resources reach the most peripheral structures ; 
(e) addressing major priority public health problems with particular emphasis on the implementation of a 
sound reproductive health program; and (f) promoting strong community participation to manage and 
help finance the functioning of health centers. 
 
C.  Project Description  
The project will provide support in the following areas : 
Page  2
a) 
Improvement in equitable access to basic and quality health services by the poor.
Key actions 
envisaged : Improving access of the poor to quality basic health services, not necessarily by expanding 
the system, but, rather, by promoting strategies aimed at bringing services closer to needy populations 
through the revision of the cost recovery policy and adoption of measures for exemption for the poor 
(exoneration, gratuity of some drugs / products such as contraceptives, etc.) and developing outreach 
strategies. Revision of the essential generics drugs policy with the adoption of an efficient supply system 
of drugs; community participation in the management of health services. There will be no construction, 
rehabilitation or land acquisition under this project. 
b) 
Adequate financing to provide equitable allocation of resources and increase financial access of 
the poor to services
.
Key actions envisaged : Re
view resource’s allocation criteria to ensure greater 
equity; adjustment of health financing mechanisms (cost recovery; implementation of Mutuals; 
mobilization of collectivities - Local government); implementation of a Medium Term Expenditures 
Framework (MTEF), which will give priority to improving the functioning of existing health facilities 
(through hiring of personnel, buying the necessary medication and ensuring that the budget for recurrent 
costs is made available) before expanding the system and will ensure that the level of funding is adequate 
to reach intended objectives; implementation of an effective management tool for financial resources and 
equipment inventory; development of programs aimed at harmonizing financial management and 
procurement procedures; budgetary decentralization management including implementation of 
performance based management within all costs centers. 
c) 
Implementation of a sound human resources strategy.
Key actions envisaged : Revision of human 
resources norms; implementation of incentive systems to encourage redeployment of personnel to existing 
facilities, especially to remote areas;  development and implementation of career plans for staff; effective 
human resources management tools; management and implementation of training strategies both for basic 
and continuing education. 
 
d) 
Improvement of capacity for overall sector management
:
Based on the lessons learned from 
previous projects in the sector in Niger, strong emphasis will be placed on strengthening the institutional 
capacity of MOH at all levels. Key actions envisaged : Improvement of capacity for policy development 
and analysis, resource allocation, performance monitoring and evaluation; clarification of the sectoral 
decentralization policy management; revision of district development policy and hospital reform; 
reorganization of central, regional and departmental services to strengthen personnel capacity and to 
insure an effective response to the implementation of health development plan; rationalization of 
investment based on a health map; implementation of hospital reform taking in account the need to ensure 
an equitable access of poor people to services at care quality; strengthening the management information 
system (SNIS); and strengthening infrastructure equipment and environmental management.
 
e) 
Addressing major priority public health problems with particular emphasis on the implementation 
of a sound reproductive health strategy
.
Key actions envisaged : Implementation of efficient programs to 
address major causes of morbidity and mortality for the less of 5 years old; implementation of a sound 
reproductive health strategy with emphasis on larger coverage of obstetrical needs in the rural areas 
strengthening of referral systems and provision of mechanisms to finance those referrals, promotion of 
modern family planning methods through workshops and training of agents, but also through raising 
awareness and encouraging the use of existing health facilities especially by women, development of a 
communication and education programs aiming at behavioral change, adequate training regarding 
reproductive health and availability of personnel. 
 
D.  Project location 
 
Project activities will take place at health facilities (hospital, clinics, centers) and at the community level 
throughout the country, with particular attention to those serving the poorest population.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
In 2003, MOH developed a National Plan for Medical Waste Management which, when submitted in the 
context of the MAP project, was found satisfactory to the IDA ISG group. The Government has started 
implementing this plan.

This project mainly focuses on institutional management and training, resulting in 
workshops, reorganization of MOH and capacity building at all levels, which may or may 
not trigger this policy. Hence the team deemed it advisable to re-disclose the previously 
approved Medical Waste Management Plan to be on the safe side.
