     The Project Development Objective is to improve the learning environment in targeted schools


                                             Page 1 of 4
   and establish systems for monitoring of education interventions and outcomes. To do this, the
   Project will finance elements of the ESP that deliver intermediate results while simultaneously
   addressing critical issues in the system to build the foundation for better management and
   efficiency within the sector.

 4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
Some aspects of the project are national and will be spread throughout the entire country. Specific
sites will however be identified prior to implementation. There are no salient physical characteristics
relevant to safeguards. Any potential adverse impacts are local and minor.

 6. Safeguard Policies       Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
 Environmental               Yes            The policy was triggered and the project is rated “B”
 Assessment OP/BP 4.01                      because of potential construction and rehabilitation of
                                            classrooms and toilet facilities under the original project
                                            and an ESMF was developed at the time. Impacts, if any,
                                            are expected to be localized and small. As project
                                            effectiveness coincided with the Ebola outbreak, most
                                            activities were put on hold and are only now resuming. As
                                            such, the ESMF prepared for the parent project has been
                                            updated and is being implemented.

                                            property.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
    A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
   1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
     and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
     Since there were no significant changes in the project activities that warrant new potential
     environmental or social impacts, the original (and restructured) project environmental category (B)
     will remain the same, no new policies are triggered, and the current project’s Environmental and
     Social Management Framework (ESMF) prepared remains valid and has been updated during
     preparation for the AF. In addition, the original REDiSL is not expected to impact any change in
     social status quo as land acquisition is not expected under any of the components supported by the
     project. On the contrary, the project is expected to have a positive social impact and this also
     applies to this AF which explicitly aims at minimizing the impact of the EVD outbreak on school-
     age children.
   2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
     in the project area:
     n/a
   3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
     impacts.
     n/a
   4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
     assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
     n/a
   5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
     on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
     The key stakeholders for this AF are school-age children and their teachers and as mentioned
     above the activities financed under this AF explicitly aim at minimizing the impact of the EVD
     outbreak on the latter and are therefore expected to have a very positive social impact. An
     Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was prepared for the original
     REDiSL and remains valid. It has been updated during preparation for the AF and will be
     disclosed upon approval by the regional adviser.

    Consultative meetings were held to solicit stakeholders’ perception of the original REDiSL project
    and sub-components and their environmental and social ramifications. Consultative meetings were
    organized with the Environment Protection Agency Sierra Leone (EPASL) to assess their capacity
    and track record in implementing and independently monitoring environmental and social impacts
    and compliance. The preliminary ESMF was presented at a one-day stakeholder consultation/
    briefing and any pertinent suggestions and recommendations made during this consultation have
    been considered in the final report.
