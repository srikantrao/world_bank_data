STATUS: PAD 
I.A.2. Project Objectives  
(a) Achieve greater awareness, understanding and acceptance from policy makers of the 
sustainable benefits that can be derived from cooperative management and 
development of the shared Nile Waters, 
(b) Establish and promote knowledge base and information on the principles and 
mechanisms for sharing potential social, economic and environmental benefits 
(c) Develop capacity of key organizations to conduct applied research on regional benefit 
sharing 
(d) Develop analytical tools and frameworks needed to design, appraise and negotiate 
cooperative development projects and initiatives.  
 
Achievement of these goals will contribute to informing and influencing decision makers, 
to strengthening the development impacts of current and planned NBI activities, and to 
motivating new cooperative activities among the Nile riparians. 
I.A.3. Project Description  
The Project will consist of three components: (i)
 
Nile Transboundary Development 
Network, (ii) Nile Transboundary Development Facility, and (iii) Project Coordination 
and Implementation.  
 
(i)
 
The Nile Transboundary Development Network
 will consist of economic planning 
and research institutions nominated by the participating countries that will work together 
to explore in depth the opportunities for cooperative socioeconomic development in the 
Nile Basin. This network of Participating Institutions (PIs) will conduct research-oriented 
activities to identify, analyze and promote the benefits and opportunities for cooperative 
regional socioeconomic development and integration.  The focus will be on 
transboundary activities involving PIs from at least two Nile countries.  Each PI will act 
as a national focal point for all Project activities, including collaboration and information 
sharing with the other SVP projects and the Subsidiary Action Programs (SAPs) of the 
Page  2
NBI, as well as national networks of relevant individuals and organizations. 
 
(ii)
 
The
 
Nile Transboundary Development Facility
 will ensure the participation and 
active engagement of a wide range of stakeholders, and will encourage other capable 
organizations within the Nile Basin to carry out complementary activities on benefit 
sharing by providing grant support.  Grantees are expected to include NGOs and other 
civil society groups as well as research and teaching institutions, while partnerships with 
the private sector will also be encouraged. Potential grantees will be invited to submit 
proposals to an annual funding competition that will reward the most promising ideas and 
concepts for innovative work on benefit sharing.  Again, the focus will be on 
transboundary activities involving grantees from at least two Nile countries, and the 
Project will facilitate the international networking needed to catalyze the planning of 
these activities. In each country the PIs will play a role in helping applicants develop their 
proposals and then in supporting the implementation of successful grantees. The Project 
will play an active role in disseminating the results of the activities supported by the 
Fund, both within the NBI family of activities and beyond. 
 
(iii) Project Coordination and Implementation
.
The SDBS Project will be managed 
by a Project Management Unit (PMU) and overseen by a Project Steering Committee.  
The PMU will be based in the same compound as the Nile-SEC in Uganda, to facilitate 
communications with other NBI activities.
 
Expected Outputs:
 
ƒ
A
network of professionals exploring opportunities for cooperative 
socioeconomic development in the Nile 
ƒ
Identification of potential cooperative benefits, and opportunities for cooperative 
regional socioeconomic development and integration 
ƒ
Principles and precedents for benefit sharing; awareness, understanding and 
acceptance from the policy makers and integration of concepts into policy 
statements. 
 
The Project will be implemented in two funding phases due to the disbursement schedules of donors into 
the multi-donor Nile Basin Trust Fund. This will not affect the overall project design. 
I.A.4. Project Location:  
The Project Management Unit will be located in Entebbe, Uganda, in a building provided by the Ugandan 
Ministry of Lands, Water and Environment, within the same complex that houses the NBI Secretariat.  It 
will promote discourse and exchange of experience among economic and policy research institutes and 
other interested parties across the Nile Basin; and among the Project Management Units of the individual 
SVP Projects.

Comments: 
The projects of the Shared Vision Program are technical assistance projects 
designed to enhance capacity, build trust and provide an enabling environment for 
cooperation between the Nile Basin countries. The SVP is anticipated to significantly 
strengthen the ability of the Nile Basin countries to cooperatively manage their resources 
in a sustainable way according to their Shared Vision “to achieve sustainable socio-
economic development through the equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the 
common Nile Basin water resources”.
