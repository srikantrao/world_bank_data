                           The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve transport accessibility along the road
                           corridor between San Ignacio de Velasco and San Jose de Chiquitos.
                            3. Project Description
                           Through a procedural error, this ISDS was not disclosed publicly before appraisal and negotiations.

                         regional access in four municipalities, namely, San JosÃ© (Chiquitos Province), San Rafael, San
                         Miguel, and San Ignacio (Velasco Province). The primary beneficiaries are close to 125,000
                         inhabitants of which 51 percent are considered poor and 62 percent are of indigenous descent,

                         together with businesses and road users who will benefit from improved local connectivity and
                         reduced travel time and vehicle operating costs along the target road.

                         Specifically, the road corridor between San Ignacio de Velasco and San Jose de Chiquitos in Santa
                         Cruz Department was selected for this project because of its strategic importance for economic
                         development and poverty alleviation at the national and regional levels. The corridor is a critical
                         component of the primary road network in Bolivia➢❨ s east, where the nation➢❨ s main agricultural
                         and hydrocarbon productivity is concentrated. The project road segment is on a north-south axis and
                         connects the two main east-west road corridors from Brazil. As such, in the longer term, the project
                         will contribute to improved connectivity of the bo-oceanic corridor (Corredor BioceÃ¡nico), with
                         widespread economic development effects. In the near term, the project will improve intra-regional
                         access in four municipalities, San JosÃ© (Chiquitos Province), San Rafael, San Miguel, and San
                         Ignacio (Velasco Province).

                         A technical, economic, social and environmental study for the upgrading of the corridor connector
                         was prepared in 2012. Following World Bank review, ABC had the study updated, with new traffic
                         count, rationalization of the design, a new economic assessment, updated EIA and RPF, RAP and
                         IPP along with population and indigenous consultations.

                         Environmental impacts of the project are expected to be moderate, temporary and reversible.
                         Appropriate mitigation measures will be adopted to protect biodiversity, and to ensure that camps
                         will have appropriate water supply and waste disposal measures, to limit wastage of water and
                         pollution within the areas around the worker camps. From environmental perspective there appear to
                         be no significant adverse impacts. On the social side, some resettlement is expected because of the
                         bypasses especially. The area is populated by two indigenous groups➢❨ native of the lowlands,

                         mostly Chiquitano population and to far lesser extent by Ayoreo communities; and to small extent by
                         Aymara and Quechua migrant populations from the Altiplano. The following safeguard policies are
                         triggered: (i) OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment); (ii) OP/BP 4.04 (Natural Habitats); (iii) OP/
                         BP 4.10 (Indigenous Peoples); OP/BP 4.11 (Physical Cultural Resources); and (v) OP/BP 4.12
                         (Involuntary Resettlement). The proposed project has two components:

                         Component A. Road Upgrading - US$225.05 million (World Bank US$225 million; Borrower US
                         $50,000). The proposed road upgrading of about 208 km connects the towns of San Ignacio de
                         Velasco and San Jose de Chiquitos in the Department of Santa Cruz. From a technical standpoint the
                         upgrading of the road is uncomplicated and for the most part will follow the existing alignment and
                         thus largely be within the already established right-of-way. The pavement will be 5 cm thick asphalt
                         concrete (AC), resting on a granular base and sub-base of 15 cm and 25 cm, respectively.
                         Construction of three bypasses will be needed to avoid heavy vehicle traffic in populated areas (San
                         Ignacio de Velasco, San Miguel, and San Rafael) as will the straightening of alignment by San
                         Diablo hill. Construction includes three small bridges (35 m, 40 m, and 46 m) and a handful of
                         existing bridges will be replaced by large box culverts. Total culverts needed on the length of the
                         route are about 300. The terrain is mostly flat to gently rolling hills. The component will cover cost
                         of feasibility and technical design remaining for one bypass, civil works, estimated cost of price
                         adjustments and variations, supervision, and technical audits, if required. Further, the component will
                         provide support (through the provision of small works, goods, training, and technical assistance, as

                         Component B. Technical Studies and Project Management - US$5 million (World Bank US$5
                         million). This component links with the main investment by financing preparatory activities for
                         upgrading the roughly 300 km San Matias-San Ignacio de Velasco road bi-oceanic corridor
                         connecting with Brazil (northern corridor), including the preparation of relevant feasibility studies
                         (including technical, economic, environmental, and social aspects) and bidding documents, excluding
                         from the project the upgrading works of the selected road segments. That northern corridor and the
                         investment under Component A form a contiguous stretch of road, more than 500 km in length. ABC
                         has decided that the studies will envision investment under a PBC methodology through a 10-year
                         DBMOT contracting approach. In addition, the component will finance relevant gender studies and
                         PSIAs. Also supported will be provision of support for the implementation and monitoring and
                         evaluation (M&E) of the project including, among others: (a) the carrying out of the project audits;
                         and (b) the carrying out of capacity-building activities on, among others, road asset management.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         This project is located in the Department of Santa Cruz. The proposed road upgrading of about 208
                         km (Component A) connects the towns of San Ignacio de Velasco and San Jose de Chiquitos. The
                         terrain is mostly flat to gently rolling hills. The (already existing) road to be upgraded is located in an
                         environment of intensive agricultural production and cattle raising. There are no critical ecological
                         habitats within the Project Area. The road to be rehabilitated between San Ignacio de Velasco and
                         San JosÃ© de Chiquitos crosses towns that contain Chiquitania churches and their related intangible
                         cultural colonial heritage. The Project area also includes a UNESCO World Heritage site, the
                         location of Jesuit churches.

                          Environmental               Yes             The project has been classified as Category B. The Project
                          Assessment OP/BP 4.01                       does not foresee significant environmental impacts that
                                                                      could jeopardize the natural but intervened environment
                                                                      in its influence area, mainly characterized by livestock

                                                                      justified by the fact that the civil works to be supported
                                                                      under the project will generate temporary and moderate

                         Most challenging environmental management issues will
                         be focused on protection and sound use of ground and
                         underground water bodies (e.g. ponds and aquifers) along
                         the road which is normally used for recreational purposes
                         by local population as well as for agricultural and
                         livestock purposes too. During the dry season, these water
                         bodies are critical for livestock and wild fauna. The
                         preservation of surface water quality and carefully
                         managed extraction of water both for the civil works and
                         for the workers➢❨ camps is a key issue to be taken into
                         account during road construction. On the other hand,
                         given that the EIA report recommends digging wells to
                         obtain water for camp sites and works, specific measures
                         to avoid aquifer contamination have been included in the
                         updated EIA report. Issues related to pedestrian health,
                         signaling and road safety aimed at mitigating accidents
                         and occupational health and safety issues during
                         construction, were updated as part of the final technical
                         design under preparation. Key to implementation will be
                         the incorporation of this measures in the contracts of the
                         supervisor and contractor in accordance with their
                         particular responsibilities.

                         jurisdictions involved in the project area with
                         participation of key stakeholders that supported the
                         project during preparation of the original EIA - and
                         EMPs. The local population emphasized issues related to
                         hiring of local workforce, location of ancillary facilities
                         and workers' residences, and behavior codes for

                         cultural impacts of different scale will be mitigated by the
                         IPP.

                         The Indigenous Peoples Policy (OP 4.10) is activated and
                         an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) for Chiquitano and
                         Ayoreo was prepared to mitigate risks such as
                         acculturation, possible illegal occupation by new settlers,
                         possible increase of deforestation and solid pollution
                         rates; the IPP also aims to prevent gender-based violence,
                         unwanted pregnancies, HIV/AIDS-STD and other

                                                        IPP components are focused on the areas of health,
                                                        education, basic services (access to water), local
                                                        economic development and cultural heritage.
                                                        Taking into account historical interethnic tensions, and
                                                        specific gender issues inside Chiquitano and Ayoreo
                                                        communities, the IPP projects allow possibilities to build
                                                        social inclusion through more horizontal pluri-ethnic
                                                        relations and gender equity for this IPs in the regional
                                                        context. Further, the IPP includes support to the
                                                        Chiquitano and Ayoreo peoples for improvement and
                                                        strengthening of indigenous territorial management; this
                                                        complements similar activities supported by a number of

                                                        Ayoreo and Chiquitano communities were consulted
                                                        during the preparation of the SA/IPP through prior, free
                                                        and informed consultations. Broad community support
                                                        was given by Chiquitano and Ayoreo people to the
                                                        proposed Project, and to the IPP. The consultations helped
                                                        to determine negative impacts and the most effective
                                                        ways of mitigating them. The consultations also helped to
                                                        design an active citizen participation during the different

                         Involuntary Resettlement Yes   This policy was triggered given that the project proposes
                         OP/BP 4.12                     new works such as bypasses in urban areas (San Miguel,

                                                     communities are needed as part of this Plan. The RAP
                                                     must be fully executed before the start of road works

                                                     Additionally, given that the designs of the bypass in San

                                                     and disclosed a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). It
                                                     is anticipated that the resettlement impacts of the San
                                                     Ignacio bypass will be moderate and can be readily
                                                     mitigated. . Approximately 30 families will be affected by

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              No large scale or significant and irreversible impacts are foreseen.

                             A significant number of workers will be involved in the road construction. During construction
                             there will be four permanent labor camps, one in each of the four Municipalities in the project area
                             (San JosÃ© de Chiquitos, San Rafael, San Miguel and San Ignacio). Additional small camps may
                             be set up temporarily for quarries and borrow bits, although it is unlikely workers will reside in
                             these. Approximately 2,000 workers (an as-yet undetermined mix of foreign and Bolivian) would
                             reside in the four camps over three years (although it can be expected that some unskilled workers
                             recruited locally may choose to continue living in their homes).

                             The project includes mitigation measures aimed at lessening the possibilities of gender-based
                             violence and child abuse perpetrated by outsiders in the communities by the road. These mitigation
                             measures include: (i) strict observance of the contractor➢❨ s code of conduct by its personnel, (ii)
                             social oversight committees organized and operating in towns with involvement of and under the
                             municipal government➢❨ s leadership and ABC➢❨ s accompaniment; (iii) strict observance of the

                             the road alignment. Additionally, during the first year, ABC will study the actual capacities of the
                             SLIM in San Ignacio. Additional support will be defined to strengthen the reference and counter-
                             reference system and institutional capacities of SLIMs during the first year. Funding for this is

                           included in the project financing.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:

                           In the event of increasing numbers of visitors to the towns along the road, an increase in public
                           services (water supply, sewerage, solid waste collection, etc.) might challenge the current
                           municipal governments' institutional capacity in terms, for instance, of available financial
                           resources, urban development planning, zoning, etc. These issues are normally addressed by local
                           governments through their corresponding Municipal Development Plans.

                           Considering the current conditions on gender and cultural, social and economic discrimination
                           suffered by Chiquitano and Ayoreo peoples, the IPP projects can have a positive impact by
                           increasing the general productivity through the economic empowerment of Chiquitano and Ayoreo
                           women, opening better opportunities for social and economic inclusion and gender equity for these
                           indigenous communities in the regional context.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           Two of the three bypasses to be constructed to avoid heavy vehicle traffic in populated areas that
                           would lead to increased pollution and noise that would be likely to have a significant impact on
                           Catholic churches considered part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site (San Miguel de Velasco
                           and in San Ignacio de Velasco). At present, freight and passenger vehicles pass through these
                           towns which have adverse impacts in terms of pollution, noise, safety and travel time. The
                           construction of the bypasses also improves quality of life for local residents.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           ABC is familiar with the World Bank social and environmental safeguards and has in place
                           reasonable standards and procedures for establishing Right of Way and compensations for
                           different groups. Their approach has included gender analysis as can be seen in the SA, IPP, RAP

                           and RPF. Other activities related to woman leadership and women empowerment are recently
                           being held as part of their national program of maintenance microenterprises. ABC's socio-
                           environmental management team carries out a social analysis as part of each road building project.
                           ABC has a national indigenous people specialist that oversees the social analysis, including
                           intercultural and gender and the development of the needed social safeguards instruments. This
                           specialist will receive additional support from the social and environmental staff in the Santa Cruz
                           regional office. Key to implementation will be the incorporation of needed environmental and
                           social measures in the contracts of the supervisor and contractor. ABC has an Environmental
                           Manual for Roads (MAC, Manual Ambiental para Carreteras) that provides an orientation guide
                           for the adequate compliance with norms and best practices for Environmental Management in road
                           works. It is an ample and specific document for road works in Bolivia. In accordance to the ABC
                           its use is mandatory, since an ABC Board of Directors resolution was issued (ABC-
                           DIR-009-2009). This Environmental Manual is fully in line with OP 4.01 and WBG EHS.
                           Moreover, use of ABC Environmental Manual and compliance is mandatory to contractors.
                           ABC's socio-environmental management team includes an Archeologist that has achieved
                           experience on archeological, historical research and restoration, conservation programs that have
                           been applied in coordination with Ministry of Cultures. Colonial and pre - Hispanic physical
                           cultural resources, have been revaluated, through some of their interventions, especially in the
                           Andean region.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure


                                                                    Page 11 of 14
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           Chiquitano and Ayoreo indigenous organizations and civil society organizations (CSO) clustered
                           around socioeconomic activities (mainly transport and livestock) are the key stakeholders in the
Public Disclosure Copy




                           project area. During the preparation of the IPP/RP the affected stakeholders belonging to some of
                           these organizations were consulted and broad community support to the proposed Project was
                           given; however, some concerns were raised related to possible negative impacts including
                           unwanted pregnancies (hijos de la carretera), road safety, non-appropriate workers' behavior, and
                           citizen security. Considering these risks and concerns, the Grievance Redress Mechanisms for the
                           social safeguard instruments (IPP/RP/RPF), were structured to cover safeguards, and non-
                           safeguards grievances and it was ensured they will be functional for any affected person during the
                           execution of the project. Also, communication, socialization and transparency about the project,
                           including communities and construction workers will be shared regularly with everyone involved
                           or affected to manage expectations and reduce risks.

                           Moreover, the project constitutes Social Oversight Committees operational from the beginning of
                           the project where each local civil society organization is asked to choose a representative to
                           accompany the implementation of the project. This participatory instance will strengthen the social
                           and environmental monitoring of the project based on the community organizational capacities.
