A.2. Project Objectives 
The project aims to reduce hardships on people and the environment that are imposed by 
current and future locust invasions.  These hardships not only include immediate effects 
such as crop and livestock losses, but also delayed effects imposed by the loss of 
productive assets and reduced income opportunities.  It is the rural poor who suffer most 
from the effects locust infestations.  The risks to people and the environment from the 
application, handling, and storage of pesticides are equally significant. 
 
The desert locust infestation is regional, thus the Project Development Objective (PDO) 
seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the concerned countries to present and future 
infestations by supporting improved strategies for prevention, early warning systems, 
reactions, and mitigation at both the national and regional levels.  This will be achieved 
by: (i) assisting countries with control and eradication of locust infestations; (ii) 
mitigating the effects of locust infestations on people and the environment; and (iii) 
helping ensure more timely reactions to future infestations in Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, 
Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, and The Gambia. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
The project will include a number of emergency activities, post
-

Page  2
activities, and activities to improve future preparedness.  These activities have been 
organized into four components: 
 
Component A: Emergency Locust Management 
This component includes investments for the emergency actions required to ensure that 
locust management activities are timely, cost-effective, and environmentally and socially 
sustainable.  Two types of activities will be supported in this component: (i) an 
emergency locust campaign required to manage any current or resurgent infestations, and 
(ii) detailed inventories of pesticides and evaluation of pesticide storage areas to ensure 
effective management after the crisis, including upgrade of storage areas, and if 
necessary, preparation for disposal of any obsolete pesticides in the country. 
 
Component B: Emergency Agriculture Investments 
This component includes investments for the emergency actions required to restore 
agricultural productivity in priority rural areas that were damaged by locusts.  
Investments to be provided through this component include provision of ‘starter packs’ 
(seeds, fertilizers, tools) and animal feed to rural populations, and may also include job 
creation for those who have lost crops/income due to locust infestation.  Such jobs will be 
created through existing community-driven development or social projects and could 
include small-scale local civil works.  Financing of activities under this component will 
complement that of other donors and will be within the framework of the needs expressed 
by FAO, WFP, and CILSS. 
 
Component C: Early Warning and Response 
This component includes medium- and long-term activities required to strengthen the 
national capacity for early warning and response to outbreaks.  World Bank financing of 
activities in this component will complement investments made by the European 
Commission and the African Development Bank for the EMPRES program initiated by 
FAO.  Investments will be made in three areas: (i) strengthening the early warning 
system procedures (capacity of crop protection agencies), (ii) equipment, software, and 
other goods required to operationalize the system, and (iii) awareness campaign and 
mobilization of village brigades for early warning. 
 
Component D: Project Management 
The output of this component will be effective project management (i.e. management 
which is, designed, adjusted, monitored, and evaluated to reflect changing conditions) 
that would be able to address potentially shifting requirements and priorities of the effort 
to help manage locust infestations, as well as their effects on people and the environment 
in the concerned countries. 
 
Activities with Regional Scope 
There are three areas of intervention that warrant a regional approach — coordination of 
locust control, research into alternatives to chemical control measures, and monitoring 
and evaluation.  Such activities will be financed through specific earmarked allocations in 
the country projects.  The coordination of the regional work would take place at periodic 
meetings of countries participating in this project, or at other relevant events such as 
sessions of CLCPRO and the DLCC.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The project will intervene in seven countries: Senegal, The Gambia, Mauritania, Mali, 
Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad. Interventions will take place primarily in the rural part of 
the Sahelian zone of these countries

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Not applicable 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The only potential long-term impact from this operation relates to the safe transport, 
storage and handling of pesticides. Such potential impacts will be mitigated through the 
adoption of the Pest Management Plan required under OP 4.09. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not applicable. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The borrowers have prepared Pest Management Plans that have been cleared by ASPEN. 
Countries have some level of capacity, but to ensure environmental safeguards are 
adhered to at a satisfactory level, the Bank project supervision will include safeguards 
specialists. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The environmental and social management plans (ESMP) will be prepared as part of the 
project (in line with OP/BP 8.50).  An ESMP for each country, acceptable to the Bank, 
will be submitted to the Bank by June 30, 2005.
