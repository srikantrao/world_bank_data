                           The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support Turkey in developing the legal, institutional and technical
                           framework for piloting carbon pricing.

                           C. Project Description
                           The PMR is a grant-based, capacity building multi-donor trust fund that provides funding and technical
                           assistance for the collective innovation and piloting of market-based instruments for greenhouse gas
                           emissions reduction. Turkey joined the PMR in 2011 and was the first country to sign a Grant Agreement with
                           the World Bank. The PMR Implementation Phase II is expected to build on the activities conducted under the
                           PMR Phase I Project.

                           The Project will include four components:

                           Component 1: Formulation of the necessary legal and institutional underpinnings for piloting an ETS (US$.35
                           million);

                           This component aims to provide technical assistance and input for the MoEU to draft the legal and
                           administrative documents, which will establish the most required legal and institutional frameworks to start
                           an ETS pilot. Those legal documents will determine, in particular, the roles and responsibilities of different
                           institutions that will be involved in the pilot scheme – including potential new structures. The draft legal
                           documents developed will be used by the ministries and agencies involved to develop the actual legislation.”
                           The major output of this component, “Technical assistance to develop the legislative and institutional
                           underpinnings, will be a “Draft Climate Change Law”[1] as a primary legislation, in addition to secondary
                           legislative outputs such as “Draft Carbon pricing/ETS Regulation” and other relevant pieces of legislation as a
                           result of the prioritization activity, i.e.; market oversight legislation, auctioning regulation, etc.

                           All draft legal documents will be presented to the CCAMCB and other high-level decision makers to inform
                           political discussions based on sound and fully fleshed proposals. At the end of the process, Turkey will be in a
                           position to ensure that the most substantial legal and institutional frameworks are in place for establishing,
                           operating and governing a robust ETS.

                           Component 2: Improving the technical underpinnings for piloting an ETS in Turkey (US$1.1 million);

                           Establishment of an ETS requires a robust technical infrastructure and capacity. The 1st Phase of PMR Turkey
                           has already assessed an implementation roadmap for an ETS pilot in Turkey. Within the light of that
                           roadmap, this Phase will carry out the technical aspects that are necessary to initiate an ETS pilot. Those
                           technical aspects include:

                                  Identification of an ETS cap and a national allocation plan: Determining the cap and development of
                                   a national allocation plan are the most important steps to start an ETS at the national level. The
                                   current MRV data will be utilized to decide the scope, allocation methodology and sector
                                   contributions to the cap.
                                  Upgrading of the current MRV register into an ETS registry: Since, 2015 the MoEU has been running
                                   an online MRV register successfully. This register needs to be upgraded to include various elements of
                                   “cap & trade” in a secure environment.
                                  Development of an ETS simulation: ETS simulation would provide crucial support in increasing the
                                   capacity and comprehension of the public and private sector on how an ETS could work and how they
                                   could benefit from such a scheme. Utilization of an ETS simulation prior to piloting would also help
                                   creating a supportive environment towards ETS.
                                  Development of complementary technical underpinnings: This activity will be reserved for technical
                                   needs that arise throughout the course of the initial stakeholder and expert feedback meetings.

                           The list of technical underpinnings to be developed under this phase might be revised in light of the
                           legislative work undertaken under Component 1 and stakeholder meetings.

                           This component will include (i) conferences, workshops, and training supporting the activities under
                           Components 1 and 2; (ii) consultation meetings with stakeholders; and (iii) public awareness activities
                           (media, high-level public/private meetings, etc.) and development of strategic communication materials.

                           Component 4: Coordination and Expert Support (US$0.28 million and US$0.045 million in-kind contribution
                           from the Turkish Government)

                           The MoEU will continue to operationalize the second phase of the PMR Project through the project
                           implementation unit (PIU) which was established under the previous phase. The PIU consists of a project
                           coordinator, a project assistant, a procurement specialist, and a financial management specialist.
