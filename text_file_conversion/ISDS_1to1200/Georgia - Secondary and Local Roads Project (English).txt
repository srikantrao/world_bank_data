A.2. Project Objectives

1. Improve the Economic and Social Well-Being of the Rural Population in Selected Areas
Through Upgrading of their Secondary and Local Road Networks

Socio-economic surveys by the consultants have confirmed that road improvements will make a significant
impact on the economic and social well-being of rural Georgia, where the majority of the poor are located.
The surveys covered a random sample of 400 persons in five districts (Lanchkhuti, Gori, Kaspi, Gurjaani and
Borjomi). In rating the various problems they face, the condition of roads ranked second only to health
services as a problem for rural residents, with 93 percent of respondents rating it an important problem.
Reduced transport costs, it was felt would increase the competitiveness of local produce, improve access to
social services, i.e. schools and medical facilities, and to off-farm employment opportunities, and in some
cases spur tourism development which in the past was an important sector of the Georgian economy.
Indicators proposed for the baseline and follow-up surveys of villages in the zone of influence of improved
roads are: (i) reduction in transport cost/time to access markets and social services, and (ii) increases in off-
farm employment income.

2.   Strengthen Institutional Capacity of the Road Department of the Ministry of Infrastructure and
Development (RDMID) to develop and maintain a cost effective and sustainable secondary and local road
network

RDMID capacity to deliver an efficient road network will depend on the adequacy of their
funding for maintenance and rehabilitation, and their ability to stretch available resources
by introducing more cost-effective techniques. Indicators proposed are: (i) reductions in
the unit costs of road works, and (ii) annual expenditures on secondary and local road
maintenance.

3. Develop RDMID's capacity to interact with communities and increase its responsiveness to local needs


RDMID responsiveness to local needs will depend on the extent to which local
communities are made aware of road programs, and the extent to which their views and
priorities are regularly expressed and taken into consideration. This requires well
functioning participatory mechanisms, for which the following indicators are proposed: (i)

Publication of an RDMID Annual Report informing on its activities including road
condition, expenditures, and public participation; and (ii) Publication of a Rolling Five-year
Road Program in order to inform the civil works related industries and other affected
interests.

The project will also assist RDMID establish regional offices to allow closer linkages with
local communities, and better monitoring of implementation.


A.3. Project Description


The project has three components: (1) rehabilitation of approximately 500 to 750 kilometers of paved
secondary and local roads, including between 150 to 250 kilometers of local roads (US$ 22.54 million); (2)
strengthening the capacity of road sector institutions by improving engineering standards and data collection
capabilities, establishing between four and six regional offices for network and works monitoring,
development and implementation of regional road maintenance plans, improved interactions with local
communities, and traffic safety enhancements (US$2.40 million); and (3) design and supervision of the road
works, and to produce reports for the Mid-Term Review to evaluate the first year program (US$2.50 million).


Trust fund support will be sought for the training of traffic police, through a twinning
arrangement, in traffic safety enforcement, crash data recording and analysis, and traffic
police work in general. Required equipment will be acquired under component (2) above.

Section II ­ Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

There are no significant impacts. All work represents road rehabilitation on existing alignments. The long
run impacts are positive; negative impacts will be minor and of brief duration as is usually associated with
any road rehabilitation activity.


D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area.

Mitigation of indirect impact is contained in the EMP. Improvement in the condition of
these roads will improve access to markets, reduce risk from accidents, and lower
emission/pollution levels. Quarries and asphalt stations will be required to have
environmental permits.

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
NA

D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

The borrower will be supported by an existing PIU that is well familiar with Bank projects
and safeguard issues. A liaison officer has been appointed in RDMID for environmental
issues. Contracts for the contractors have been appraised to ensure compliance with both
Bank and Georgian requirements.

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

The Ministry of Environment and National Resources (MENR), Ministry of Infrastructure and Development
(MID), and the Road Department of the MID (RDMID) are the key stakeholders. Liaison officers between
the MENR and RDMID have been appointed. There has been and will be open public participation. Road
Management Committees, or equivalent, have been established in local government entities (Raions). These
RMCs will assist in the selection and prioritization process. Consultations have or will take place in
conjunction with the preparation of the EA for each road segment.
