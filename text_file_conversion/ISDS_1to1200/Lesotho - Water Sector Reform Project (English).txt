A.2. Project Objectives : 
The project development objective is to support the vision of the Government of Lesotho 
to secure adequate, sustainable, and clean water supply and to support adequate sanitation 
services for consumers living in the Lowlands areas. 
 
This objective will be accomplished 
by an APL in two phases.  In the first phase, this objective will be reached by: (a) 
supporting the implementation of the 1999 Water Resource Management Strategy and its 
related institutional sector reforms; (b) providing for capacity building to ensure sector 
policy formulation is coordinated with proposed sector legal and regulatory utility 
reforms; (c) providing for new management mechanisms that promote commercial 
incentives in the main sector utility - WASA; and (d) financing needed infrastructure for 
augmenting urban water supply in Maseru with a particular emphasis on high growth 
peri-urban and industrial areas.   Phase II of the APL will be focused on augmenting the 
bulk supply for the Lowland that will directly address the current overwhelming water 
scarcity situation.  Phase II is timed to take advantage of the current detailed studies 
supported by GoL and the EU that will determine the optimized long term solution.  
A.3. Project Description : Phase I: US$ 15.0 million (FY05-07): 
Component 1:
  Policy Implementation and Capacity Building in the Ministry of Natural 
Resources (MNR) (US$ 3.0 million). This component will focus on the implementation 
of the recent institutional changes undertaken within the Ministry of Natural Resources as 
recommended under the 1999 Polic

capacity building for the newly established Commissioner of Water and the Policy, 
Planning, and Strategy Unit (PPSU).  
Component 2:
 Augmentation and Extension of Maseru Water Supply (US$ 10.0 million). 
The component would include selected civil works to augment water treatment and 
extensions to the distribution system and supporting TA of about US$ 8.7 million.  It 
would also support a Performance Agreement between the Water and Sanitation 
Authority (WASA) and the GOL for about US$ 1.3 m.  This agreement is aimed at 
strengthening the commercial, financial and technical operations of the utility as well as 
its autonomy and accountability.  
Component 3:
 Maseru Community Water and Sanitation Program (US$ 2 million). This component is 
designed as a pilot to provide an opportunity for the stakeholders involved (WASA, Maseru City Council, 
Ministry of Local Government, DRWS, DWA) to test different service options and delivery mechanisms 
for the delivery of water to six peri-urban communities.  A number of different service delivery options (for 
example, handpumps for the very poor, shared standposts, kiosks, coupon systems, etc.) would be 
implemented and evaluated.  
A.4. Project Location and Salient Physical Characteristics Relevant to the Safeguard 
Analysis: 
Project area centered at 27

30'E, 29
0
20'S in Maseru, capital of Lesotho, area adjacent to the Mohokare 
(Caledon) River (= international boundary between Lesotho and South Africa) of which Botswana and 
Namibia are also riparians.  Area consists of rolling terrain, small hills and low ridges covered by 
grassland, but is urbanized to a great extent. Local elevation is 1400-1550masl. Area receives ~700mm 
rainfall per year, with distinct wet and dry seasons. Emergency releases of water from Highland 
Project ~130km upstream from existing storage reservoir.  Lack of wastewater management results in 
untreated and poorly treated discharges to the Mohokare.

Comments: 
It is expected that the project will improve the quality of life and health of the urban population 
around Maseru. Currently only about 50% of all  residents are served by piped systems. Vulnerability to 
water shortages is high as groundwater resources are meager. This is particularly difficult for the unserved 
poor also rely on point source supplies, boreholes, handpumps and springs.  Pilot projects under the 
Community Water Supply and Sanitation component focus on these communities.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
(a)  Impacts will be mainly local (construction) or regional (river water augmentation and extraction). 
Severe impacts (construction and disruption) will be short-term (days or weeks) and localized. All 
significant impacts mitigable through EMP or design considerations. 
(b) Incremental abstractions from the Mohokare (Caledon) river are small in comparison 
to MAR.    Riparian countries have been notified and have raised no objections. 
(c) Acquisition of up to 3 hectares of  unencumbered land. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
Enhanced security of water supply to Maseru urban area plus extension of supply to 
larger peri-urban areas will encourage development and lead to increased long-term 
demands for household and industrial water.  
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
1. 
Increase in storage capacity of Maqalika Reservoir initially planned but now discounted because 
of difficult involuntary relocation issues and demonstrated feasibility of an alternative. 
2. 
Improved use of renewable water supply (rainwater) would have environmental benefits but not 
technically feasible on required scale. 
3. 
Studies underway to identify a second source of water to meet future needs but no alternative 
currently identified to existing source to meet immediate demand. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
a)  The Environmental Assessment (EA) has been approved and released for public 
disclosure as well as submitted to the National Environment Secretariat.  A detailed 
Environmental Management Plan
 has been prepared to address all identified impacts. 
The costs of undertaking the EMP are included in the project.  These are estimated at 
about 1% of the costs of the capital works program or about US$ 70,000.  This will 
include, for example, the preparation of guidelines for contracts and support for the 
Environmental Officer in WASA.   
b) No resettlement is anticipated but because the actual impacts resulting from the 
limited land acquisition required (about 3 hectares) are not yet known, a 
Policy 
Framework for Land Acquisition and Compensation
 was prepared by WASA and 
approved by the Board.  It was publicly disclosed along with the EA report.  
c)  All riparians are signatories to SADC Protocol on Shared Water Course Systems and 
have been notified of project details.  No objections to project. Good channels of 
communication. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
(a) 
Users are the main stakeholders - interface with project via public & community 
relations department which deals with affectees on pertinent issues.  EA will be disclosed in-country 
and at Infoshop prior to Appraisal. 
(b) 
Other river users have channel to project authorities via respective agencies (DWA in 
Lesotho, DWAF in South Africa). Both countries members of SADC Water Resources Coordination 
Unit and have close relationship forged through the joint Lesotho Highlands Water Project.
