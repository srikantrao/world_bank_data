                         Component (1): Modernizing the Higher Education System

                         b.       This component will support the government in modernizing the higher education sector by:
                         (i) strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Higher and Specialized Secondary Education to
                         manage the sector; (ii) supporting the State Testing Center to develop and implement the system of
                         external quality assurance; (iii) facilitating the Higher Education Institutions to strengthen the system
                         of internal quality assurance; and (iv) establishing a competitive fund for HEIs.

                         c.    The Government of Uzbekistan’s decision to launch a university ranking system, whose
                         indicators are broadly in line with premier international ranking systems, is indicative of the
                         Government’s desire to reform its higher education system so that it may be recognized to be of high
                         quality by its peers at the international level while also serving to improve both the quality and
                         relevance of this system to needs of the economy. This component will assist the Government in
                         achieving this objective.
                         Sub-component 1.1: Strengthening Higher Education Management
                         d.      The centrally managed higher education system of Uzbekistan is critically dependent upon
                         the quality of guidance, support and direction given by the Ministry of Higher and Specialized
                         Secondary Education. This subcomponent will support:

                         i.      capacity building and training of the MHSSE and other agencies dealing with higher
                         education on policy formulation and implementation;
                         ii.     the MHSSE in providing capacity building programs for HEIs in management and
                         accountability;
                         iii.    the development of a HEMIS.
                         Sub-component 1.2: Improving the Quality Assurance System
                         e.      A modern quality assurance system is key to ensuring the quality and relevance of academic

                         programs and graduates in the higher education sector. In order to help strengthen the QA
                         mechanisms in Uzbekistan this subcomponent will support:

                         i.      the STC to strengthen the Quality Assurance Process in conformance with Bologna Protocol
                         requirements, establish partnerships with relevant EU QA organizations, and develop and implement
                         the university ranking system;
                         ii.     the HEIs in development of internal quality assurance mechanism through the establishment
                         of Quality Enhancement Cells (QECs) in HEIs. QECs are the focal offices for internal quality
                         assurance and help inform campus decision-making by collecting, analyzing and reporting
                         quantitative and qualitative data about their HEIs’ students, faculty, staff, curriculum, course
                         offerings, and learning outcomes. The project can finance a foreign partner (with MHSSE) to deliver
                         a custom-tailored course to HEIs on establishing an office for Institutional Research/QEC in each
                         university.
                         Sub-component 1.3: Establishing a Competitive Innovation Fund
                         f.    The fund offers grant funding to competitively selected proposals from HEIs for designing and
                         implementing innovative projects which contribute to enhancing the quality and market relevance of
                         university activities and encourage creativity and innovation. This component will finance two pilot
                         rounds of competition at 1 million USD per round. If they are deemed successful according toagreed
                         performance indicators , the competitive grants program will be scaled up for two additional rounds
                         with Bank financing and co-financing from the government. Individual grants will be restricted to a
                         maximum of 150,000 USD. The fund will support HEIs in:
                         •�establishing partnerships with both domestic and foreign academic institutions (research
                         partnerships, faculty exchange, training);
                         •�establishing partnerships with domestic and foreign industry (modernizing curriculum, innovation,

                         research, and joint business development);
                         •�innovations in teaching and learning to expand access (e-education, MOOCS, etc.)

                         Component (2): Improving laboratories and associated academic and research systems in priority
                         areas
                         g.     Delivery of high quality higher education in areas of science, technology and engineering is
                         critically dependent on the availability of requisite laboratories where students may carry out virtual
                         or practical experiments that illustrate practical implementation of theoretical principles. These
                         laboratories provide a forum for students to integrate knowledge in multiple areas and demonstrate
                         their application to issues of practical concern. Successful implementation of this system ensures to
                         establish close collaboration between academia and industry.

                         h.     While the availability of high quality laboratories is a pre-requisite to the establishment of
                         university – industry linkages, it does not represent the complete story since without the requisite
                         curriculum and appropriately qualified and trained faculty good linkages cannot be established and
                         sustained. GoU’s (Decree 1533) on Modernization of Material and Technical Base of the Higher
                         Educational Institutions is directed towards the development of human and technical resources to
                         have a significant impact on the universities’ ability to address needs of the priority economic
                         sectors. To support this objective universities will be requested to develop comprehensive proposals
                         that move significantly beyond the development of specialized laboratories and focus on economic
                         development of the country in priority areas. The proposals will include the intended use of the
                         equipment, the development and adoption of modern curriculum supporting the laboratories
                         requested, mechanisms for linkage with industry, and a plan to develop and ensure availability of
                         qualified faculty trained to optimize use of requested facilities.
                         International collaborative arrangements for curriculum development, student and faculty exchange

                         and development of systems for enhancement of university – industry relations would be expected to
                         constitute an essential part of the laboratory development proposals.

                         i.   The proposed component will support:

                         i.       the establishment/upgrading of modern scientific and research laboratories in Uzbek HEIs in
                         priority areas of the economy;
                         ii.      the development and implementation of a modern curriculum optimizing the use of the
                         equipment provided;
                         iii.     the establishment of appropriate local and international partnerships and networks;
                         iv.      training of faculty and staff for optimal use of the equipment and, in collaboration with
                         international academic and local industrial partners.

                         Component (3): Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation and Capacity Building

                         j.    The MHSSE, supported by the Project Management Team (PMT), will ensure overall
                         management of the project, including monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the investment. The
                         component will support:

                         i.      financing of a PMT with core staff from MHSSE supported by consultants from the market
                           as needed. The PMT will be responsible for overall project management and coordination,
                           communication flow and dissemination of information;
                           ii.     implementation and management of the procurement process, financial management and

                           disbursement, project monitoring and reporting, including training to PMT staff to enable them to
                           discharge these functions;
                           iii.    systematic maintenance of M&E system with updates on key performance indicators;
                           iv.     provide technical assistance in carrying surveys, tracer studies, and other evaluations of
                           system performance (as needed);
                           v.      information exchange and dissemination of results to stakeholders.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project will be implemented all over Uzbekistan. At this point no civil works are envisaged
                           however the project is rated B to account for the possibility that some minor rehabilitation of labs
                           and universities can be associated with the purchase of new equipment and also operations of the
                           renewed labs involving processing of hazardous substances and using animals as test systems .
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The borrower has an institutional capacity to implement safeguards policies. There is a clear
                           commitment to involve the faculty and staff from the the occupational health and safety and
                           environment department of the technical university in Tashkent in terms of the managing
                           environmental issues under the project.
