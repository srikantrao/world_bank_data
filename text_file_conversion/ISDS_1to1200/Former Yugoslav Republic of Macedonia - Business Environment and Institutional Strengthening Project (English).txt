C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
In support to a potential component of the Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PSAL1) planned for FY06, 
and the PSAL2 foreseen for FY07 the proposed operation will support the Government in implementing a 
coherent agenda for regulatory reforms through the following components:  
(i) Improvement to business entry and operations (estimated US$ 4.0 million)

The component would finance: 
(a) the reform of the regulatory and administrative framework, to streamline business licensing 
procedures and market inspections on the national and municipal levels; 
(b) the development of the legal framework and the capacity of the Ministry of Economy and the 
Secretariat of the Government, to ensure effective implementation of appropriately adapted 
regulatory impact analysis for new and existing regulations;  
(c)  capacity building for the entities involved in registration, licensing and inspections, to enforce the 
new regimes; 
(d)  information systems, to  enhance: (i) information exchange between government entities involved 
in the business registration, licensing and inspections; and (ii) public information access.

trengthening of  enterprise sector뭩 competitiveness and enhancing market competition 
(estimated US$ 2.5 million + potential 3.0 million for testing facilities); 
The component would finance:  
(a)  strengthening of the MSTQ system to bring it closer to EU standards, according to the results of 
the review of the regulatory and institutional framework for the MSTQ system  that will be 
carried out during project preparation. Under co-financing arrangements, the component might 
also support the upgrading of few selected testing laboratories/centers on a pilot basis;  
(b)  strengthening of the regulatory and enforcement capacity of the anti-trust authority; and

with relevant EU legislation (e.g., consumer privacy and data protection); and 
(b)  the upgrading of the public credit register run by the Central Bank. 
 
Main institutions involved.   
Key institutions would include the Ministry of Economy, the MBDP, the 
Central Registry, the anti-trust authority, the Central Bank, and the MSTQ system institutions. The 
establishment of a committee of representatives of main stakeholders will help coordination and 
implementation of the project activities.
