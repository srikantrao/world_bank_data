                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The proposed Project Development Objective is to: (i) build local capacity and empowerment for
                           participatory development; and (ii) improve access to social and economic infrastructure services to
                           communities in the project area (including communities located along the CASA1000 transmission
                           line).
                           C. Project Description
                           13. The proposed project will consist of three components: (i) Community grants for (economic and
                           social infrastructure) sub-projects; (ii) Community mobilization, capacity building, communication
                           and outreach; and (iii) Project implementation support. The key features of each component are
                           likely to be:

                           Component 1: Community Grants for sub-projects ($7.50m)

                           14. Component 1 will provide grants directly to communities to fund social and economic
                           infrastructure subprojects (including sub-projects which will enable communities to obtain more
                           regular power supply). Targeted villages will be supported in developing local investment plans
                           through a participatory process in which local communities assess local needs, and carry out
                         participatory identification of priorities, similar to the VIP3 project approach. Special attention will
                         be paid to the participation of women so as to cater to their specific needs and priorities. The project
                         will also pay special attention to the participation of young men, especially in fragile and conflict-

                         affected areas where they are often involved in violence and where there is a potential of
                         radicalization. The size of the block grants provided to participating communities will be based on
                         criteria agreed during preparation, similar to VIP3; the implementation arrangements for the
                         selection of the grants will also be defined before appraisal.

                         Component 2: Community-mobilization, capacity-building, communication and outreach ($2.00m)

                         15. The objective of this component is to build the awareness, develop capacity and mobilize
                         community participation in sub-project planning, implementation and, as appropriate, operations and
                         maintenance. As is the norm for Bank-financed CDD projects, community-level activities will aim to
                         ensure sub-investments are needs-based, empower communities with decision-making and build
                         ownership and sustainability of sub-projects in order to maximize the development outcomes for the
                         rural poor.

                         16. The IA will assign staff to help build capacity and ownership through a number of activities,
                         such as: (i) participatory planning and prioritization; (ii) community governance and accountability
                         systems, including mechanisms for conflict resolution; (iii) participatory monitoring of construction
                         and procurement; (iv) grass-roots financial management of community-implemented investment
                         schemes; and (v) the necessary communication with subnational and national government and
                         contractors building the CASA-1000 transmission line. These activities will not be limited to small-
                         scale infrastructure investment, but also potentially address other issues which affect the
                         development and security of target communities. Investments in activities that support youth
                         development, for instance, may also be eligible under this (and the first) component.

                         17. In addition to community mobilization, this component will also finance a highly visible and
                         intensive communications campaign and access to information effort designed to reach relevant

                         stakeholders within the concerned oblasts in the south, but with a special emphasis on outreach to
                         communities in the project areas. A multi-media communications strategy will be at the core of
                         information sharing efforts, designed with the aim of ensuring that information on the CASA1000
                         project implementation progress and impacts is conveyed to interested members of Government,
                         civil society and the citizenry more broadly. To ensure that CSP communities living in the
                         CASA1000 corridor are effectively reached, the communications strategy will take into account their
                         infrastructure access, literacy rates, and language. In addition, it will also ensure that feedback loops
                         (perception surveys, community participatory monitoring and grievance handling mechanisms)
                         between the corridor communities and the implementing agency are put in place. The activities of
                         this subcomponent are aimed at creating the conditions for smooth construction of the CASA1000
                         transmission line.

                         Component 3: Project management, communication and outreach ($0.50m)

                         18. This component will finance incremental costs of the IA for project management, specifically
                         coordination and supervision of implementation activities, financial management, annual audits, and
                         monitoring and evaluation. The management and coordination of the project will be the
                         responsibility of a dedicated project management team established within the implementing agency.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The planned project activities will take place along the AC transmission line (approx. 450 km). The

                           line will follow the borders of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, passing through regions that are
                           economically weak and isolated, prone to regular ethnic tensions and heated exchanges between
                           Kyrgyz and Uzbek border guards (Jalal-Abad, Osh and Batken oblasts). Issues related to land,
                           particularly concerning involuntary resettlement, may be particularly sensitive. Careful attention will
                           be paid to land tenure and land issue as a conflict stressor during the project preparation to assess
                           potential consequences to resettlement should it take place due to project activities.
                           E. Borrowerâ€™s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The implementing agency has prior experience of implementing Bank-financed projects and
                           demonstrates strong familiarity of and capacity to implement Bank safeguard policies.
