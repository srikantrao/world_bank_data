                                 1. Reporting - Hiring of a consultancy that will prepare the Ghana EITI National Reports for 2015 and
                                    2016.
                                 2. Outreach - Outreach to Ghana's artisanal and small scale miners (ASMs) on the EITI process and to
                                    sub-national civil society organizations (CSOs) on the recent changes to the EITI Standard.
                                 3. Dissemination - Dissemination of the Ghana EITI Reports for 2015 and 2016 as well as the publication

                          E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                          This project will focus on providing technical and financial assistance to Ghana's EITI Secretariat towards
                          Ghana's continued participation in the EITI process. There are no expected social and environmental impacts
                          of this activity. The borrower's institutional capacity for safeguard policies has thus not been evaluated as no
                          safeguards issues will be triggered by this project/activity.
