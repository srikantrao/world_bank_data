A.2. Project Objectives 
The project’s objective is to increase RWSS service access and achieve effective and 
sustained use of improved Community Water and Sanitation (CWS) services in small 
towns in a total of six regions, including the four already participating regions. 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The Project comprises the following three components: 
 
Component 1 - Community Subprojects Component
(US$ 21.6 million).
 
This component will provide 
resources for water and sanitation services in three types of contexts: 
 
(a)  small towns subprojects planned but not implemented under CWSP2-
1
(i.e., ‘carryover’ activities, to 
be implemented under CWSP2-2 as a part of retroactive financing); 
(b)  new small town systems (planned and implemented under STWSSP); and 
(c) 
rehabilitation of small towns systems (planned and implemented under STWSSP) 
 
Component 2 - Sector Support 
(US$ 3.1 million).
 
This component will support training and technical 
assistance for major stakeholders to improve their capacity to ensure adequate provision of goods and 
services at the local level.   
 
Component 3 - Program Management
(US$ 1.3 million) This component will provide CWSA with a 
management fee equal to five percent of the funds disbursed under the project to support the incremental 
costs incurred by the Agency to implement the project.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The project will be located in six regions in Ghana (Upper East, Upper West, Ashanti, 
Brong Ahafo, Central, and Western Regions).

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project will have significant positive impacts on the population’s health and quality 
of life through a reduction in water borne diseases.  There are no foreseeable negative 
social or environmental issues implicated.   
 
Potential site specific impacts include: 
‰\03
Water sources must be checked for quality to confirm water quality standards are 
met.  
‰\03
Water sources must be checked for safe yield and impact on surrounding wells. 
‰\03
Water sources must be designed and constructed to prevent contamination. 
‰\03
Wastewater at outlets must be disposed of properly. 
‰\03
Measures to mitigate erosion and loss of vegetation must be provided in 
construction contracts. 
Individuals must be compensated for lost property and income as a result of the 
construction 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
No adverse long-term impacts are anticipated. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Alternate sources will be considered as and when appropriate. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Prior to appraisal, the Borrower prepared an Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) for civil works and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF).  The 
two reports have been reviewed and final versions disclosed in the InfoShop. 
 
CWSA and Districts will be staffed with personnel qualified to manage the preparation of 
EMPs and RAPs,  during Project implementation. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders are the Ministry of Works and Housing, the Community Water and 
Sanitation Agency and the small towns the water supply systems will serve and benefit.  
Safeguards documents (ESMF) and RFP have been disclosed according to Bank policy 
through the InfoShop, World Bank headquarters, Washington DC and in Ghana, both 
centrally and in the Districts.  Participating small towns will prepare sub-project 
proposals.  Proposal preparation will include an environmental screening process and 
Page  4
preparation of environmental mitigation measures and RAPs as required.  Proposals will 
be reviewed and cleared by Districts (District Water and Sanitation Teams and District 
Environmental Management Committees, as appropriate).  Environmental mitigation 
measures and RAPs will be disclosed to small town residents through focus group 
discussions.
