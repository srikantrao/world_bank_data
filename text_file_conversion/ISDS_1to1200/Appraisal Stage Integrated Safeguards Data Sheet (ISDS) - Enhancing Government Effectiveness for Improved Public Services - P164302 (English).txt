          The project development objective is to improve core government functions for service delivery in priority sectors.

       C. Program Description

      1.        The project development objective is to improve core government functions for service delivery in priority
      sectors. This IPF will provide technical assistance (TA) support for selected parts of the Economic Governance for Service
      Delivery Program (EGSDP) of the government which is also being supported by a PforR. On the one hand, it will include
      three of the EGSDP horizontal reforms: Performance Budgeting; Public Procurement; and Information for Decision Making
      (statistics). On the other hand, it will cover three of the four EGSDP sectors: General (Primary and Secondary) Education,
      Transport Infrastructure, and Financial Sector. The logic of the operation is to combine the horizontal reform across the
      government with addressing bottlenecks related to the specific reform areas in the targeted sectors.
      2.        The five axes of the EGSDP are:
           Axis 1: Improving domestic revenue mobilization
           Axis 2: Strengthening performance-based budgeting and procurement
           Axis 3: Facilitating service delivery and improving the quality of services provided to citizens
           Axis 4: Reinforcing the production and quality of economic and social statistics
           Axis 5: Enhancing Access to Financial Services

      3.      The proposed IPF will provide TA support related to activities under three of the five axes (axes 2, 3, and 5): (i)
      Strengthening performance-based budgeting and procurement; (ii) improved Management of General Education
      Resources; (iii) Improved Management of the Road Network; and (iv) Increased Access to Financial Services.

      Axis 2: Strengthening performance-based budgeting and procurement
      4.      This axis supports horizontal reforms across the government including in two areas that will be supported under
      the TA: (i) Performance based budgeting: Improving strategic allocation of resource and budget execution through
      establishing program and multi-annual budgeting; setting up of performance indicators; and devolution of commitment
      authority to line ministries; and (ii) Procurement: Leveraging E-procurement and contract management for value for
      money. This project TA will support two of these areas, performance budgeting and procurement as summarized below.
      5.     The proposed project will provide TA to support government implementation of Performance-Based Budgeting.
      Supporting EGSDP objectives, the operation will focus on (i) developing a methodological framework to support key line

 ministries in shifting from inputs to outcomes and putting in place a new performance evaluation system.(ii) implementing
 program budgets, (iii) setting up a comprehensive performance monitoring framework to properly assess the results of
 the public policies and program budgets that will be financing (objectives, key performance indicators, annual projects of
 performances, annual reports on performances) and (iv) strengthening the implementation of a Result Monitoring
 Framework with available M&E information and results/causal chains underlying the Government’s program.
 6.       The project will support the government to implement a whole of government e-procurement system. The
 system will be expanded over time to all 40 ministries and relevant contracting authorities of government and will facilitate
 the online review of procurement packages from application through the award to contracts. This will enable
 procurement packages to be review electronically and is expected to reduce the approval delays and improve the
 transparency and responsiveness of the review system. The TA support include the beta testing of the ongoing of the
 readiness of the overall system that has been designed by the relevant public procurement bodies, to expedite an effective
 roll out of the system to all 40 ministries.
 7.       The project will also support cross-cutting capacity building in public sector reforms including strengthening
 public policy making and citizen engagement. These activities will be implemented through the National Program for
 Capacity Building (PPRC) which has an ongoing program of activities and reform support strategy which the TA would scale
 up in relevant areas.

 Axis Three: Facilitating service delivery and improving the quality of services provided to citizens

 This priority axis aims to improve service delivery in three sectors, primary health, general education, and road
 infrastructure. The proposed TA would support capacity strengthening and reform activities in two of the three priority
 sectors—General Education and Roads Infrastructure.
 General Education Resources and Services
 8.      The proposed TA would support the Ministry of National Education, Technical Education, and Vocational
 Training (MENET-FP) to undertake an audit of the entire textbook supply chain from planning and procurement, to
 production to final delivery to understand the key bottlenecks and dysfunctions in the system, and support the
 implementation of remedial activities and systems with a view to ensuring that at by the end of the project, at least 80%
 of students have necessary textbooks by the beginning of the school year.
 Improved Management and Maintenance of the Road Network
 9.     This axis aims to strengthen the management of the implementation for roads infrastructure across road
 network. This will be achieved by putting in place a transparent and monitorable performance monitoring tool for the
 implementation of works contracts. This should ultimately help to reduce transportation costs for citizens as a well
 maintained and can facilitate easy access for citizens.
 10.     The project will support the government to will put in place a mechanism to evaluate performance to improve
 the planning and contract management of works and maintenance contracts at all stages of contract management during
 implementation road infrastructure. The proposed performance management tool will be available online and will
 monitorable and searchable. It will also include the classifications of works contracts based on their past performance.
 Axis Five: Enhancing Access to Financial Services
 11.     The three main objectives of this program axis are: (i) Strengthen financial infrastructure to promote financial
 inclusion and SMEs; (ii) Expand digitization of payments to service providers and tax payers; and (iii) Facilitate consumer
 knowledge of and access to financial services. The proposed TA would support to first and third of these objectives.

 12.      This TA will support the strengthening of Côte d’Ivoire’s financial infrastructure (e.g., credit information
 reporting, secured transactions and insolvency) as are these are important for enabling access to credit and accelerating
 economic development. The project will support: (i) the development and equipment of a national credit collateral
 registry; (ii) the digitalization and integration of the RCCM records with the Tribunal de Commerce (TCA) to facilitate
 insolvency resolution; and (iii) the creation of a platform to make credit data available for loan decisions.
 13.      The TA will also support the operationalization of the Financial Services Observatory (l’Observatoire de la
 Qualité des Services Financiers) which has been established by the government. This will include ensuring it has adequate
 capacity to: i) promote the transparency and comparability of financial services and products; ii) manage consumers’
 complaints and provide a mediation mechanism; and iii) promote financial education. Its jurisdiction will extend over
 banks, microfinance institutions, e-money issuers, and insurance companies. It will manage a comparator of key selected
 retail financial services and products to promote transparency and comparability. It will function also as financial
 ombudsman to solve disputes between financial services providers and consumers.
