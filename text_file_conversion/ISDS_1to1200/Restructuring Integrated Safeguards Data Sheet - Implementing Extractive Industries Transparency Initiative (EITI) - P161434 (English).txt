            Implementing Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) (P161434)



    Current Project Development Objective
    The proposed DO is to foster enhanced transparency and accountability in extractive industries by supporting the MEM
    on leading the implementation of the EITI in accordance to the Standard 2016.

    3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION


         On July 2, 2019, the Government requested an extension of closing date and additional funds in the amount of US
$250,000. This restructuring is being processed to include US$250,000 additional funding and to extend the closing date
for 14 months from December 24, 2019 to February 24, 2021. This will allow full implementation of the EITI work program,
leading to the Dominican Republic’s international EITI validation. This is the second extension of the closing date. The first
extension was necessary to allow processing time for the additional funds. The additional funds in the amount of US
$250,000 is sought to allow the Dominican Republic to upgrade its current progress for EITI implementation by financing
strategic activities related to the EITI work program. These activities included mainstreaming the reporting process,
capacity building for in-house production of EITI annual reports, and sustainable operations by the DR-EITI Secretariat.
The existing project description, PDO, and monitoring indicators continue to be relevant and support the activities to be
covered under the additional financing. This restructuring does not change the Environmental Assessment category and
like the parent project does not trigger any safeguard policies.
         The detailed activities to be carried out through the additional financing will continue to facilitate quality control
of information on extractives sector companies keeping them in line with the EITI Standard. DR-EITI Operations and
Production of the Third EITI Report for 2017 and 2018 will be supported by these activities. This would support the hiring
of a consultant to advise the DR-EITI Secretariat team on producing the 2017 and 2018 EITI reports in-house (partially
mainstreamed while the mainstreaming work takes place in parallel) by elaborating a feasibility study and technical
solution for EITI mainstreamed reporting. A potential host platform for the EITI reporting process will be proposed. The
technical solution will set out a proposed IT systems architecture, frequency of data flows, data exchange protocols, etc.,
for an upgrade of the current EITI Portal in line with the EITI Standard. This will also contribute to the development of a
roadmap and a funding strategy for securing support for “EITI mainstreaming? implem entation. In addition, regulations
for disclosure of data will be enhanced. The DR-EITI website will be redesigned to include aspects for mainstreaming the
EITI data (interim mainstreaming strategy). In addition, support for Multi-stakeholder Group (MSG) training in relation to
media engagement will be funded.
