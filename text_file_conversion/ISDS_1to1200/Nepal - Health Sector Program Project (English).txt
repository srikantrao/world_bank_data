A.2. Project Objectives

The proposed Nepal Health Sector Program Project will support the Government's Nepal Health Sector
Program ­ Implementation Plan (NHSP-IP). The development objective is to expand access to, and
increase the use of, essential health care services, especially by underserved populations. This will be
accomplished through developing and disseminating services standards; employing behavior change
communication to affect care-seeking and the attitudes of providers; decentralizing responsibilities and
authorities to districts and communities; contracting the private sector to complement public sector
services; improving planning, budgeting and fiduciary management; developing financing strategies which
improve resource allocation and better protect the poor; improving the deployment of staff, and closely
monitoring and evaluating the impact of these health sector strategies on access, utilization and coverage.

Four key indicators will be used to attain of the Development Objective. These are (i) Contraceptive
Prevalence Rate increases to 55%, (ii) 50% of women who deliver with a skilled attendant, (iii) Measles
and DPT3 coverage increases to 80%, and (iv) Percent of adults who can correctly identify one method of
preventing HIV infection. Each indicator will be stratified in order to assess progress in reaching
underserved populations.

A.3. Project Description

The NHSP-IP, describes two broad areas of work, here referred as project components: (i) Strengthened
Service Delivery; and (ii) Institutional Capacity and Management Development. Although wide in scope,
it should be recognized that the Sector Program consolidates multiple projects, and thus encompasses
technical and material support from numerous development assistance partners. IDA's financing will
disburse against the entire program, but policy and strategic dialogue, monitoring and technical inputs will
recognize the Bank's comparative advantage and to complement that of other partners.

Component 1 - Strengthened Service Delivery:

Essential Health Care Services (EHCS) (WHO, UNICEF, DfID, USAID, UNFPA): The Program will
support the expansion and/or strengthening of eleven priority cost-effective services. Expansion of each of
these services will be phased: nationwide services with demonstrated success will be maintained, those
with successful models but limited coverage will be expanded, and other key services without effective
models yet will be refined and then expanded. EHCS will be strengthened by: (i) developing and
implementing technical standards to improve service quality;(ii) providing in-service training to upgrade
the technical skills of about 10,000 field workers; (iii) ensuring drug availability in health facilities by
improved drug procurement and distribution; (iv) using behavior change communication (BCC) to inform
the public about services; to promote healthy behaviors; and to promote a client focused, gender-sensitive

attitude among the providers; (v) improving outreach activities especially in the Mid and Far-Western
Regions; (vii) contracting NGOs for service delivery to eight municipalities; and (viii) conducting Service
Delivery Surveys (SDS) to obtain client and provider experience of and perceptions about the quality and
adequacy of health services.

Greater local authority and responsibility over service provision (IDA, GTZ): The program will support
capacity building for managing decentralized health services. By the conclusion of the 5-year program,
responsibility and authority over health posts and sub-health posts throughout the country will be handed
over to Local Bodies (i.e., local government structures). The program will articulate roles and functions of
the Local Bodies in the health sector and provide training in leadership, setting local priorities in health,
personnel management, performance appraisal, planning, budgeting, financial accounting and controls.
MOH officials at all levels will be oriented on how they can help to advance the decentralization process.

Public-Private Partnerships (IDA, USAID): The MOH will appoint a focal point for PPP and social
exclusion issues. The program will support guidelines, designing contracts, regulatory framework and
training. New service provider agreements/contracts will be defined with NGOs and the private sector.
Large district/zonal hospitals will be made autonomous, and NGOs/private sector will be contracted to
manage others.

Component 2 - Institutional Capacity and Management Development:

Sector management (IDA): The program aims to develop and/or strengthen capacity in planning, budgeting
and financial management. Functions and responsibilities for each arm of the MOH will be reviewed and
made explicit. A management training program will be developed and implemented by the Nepal
Administrative Staff College. The shift to a sector-wide approach is also intended to strengthen the
ministry's capacity to plan, manage and implement a more cohesive development strategy.

Sustainable health financing (DfID, ILO/STEP, IDA): The sector-wide approach will provide greater
transparency as regards resource allocation through the MTEF and PER, and as donor inputs are brought on
budget. The annual PER -- together with the monitoring of implementation and results -- is expected to
inform efforts to improve allocative efficiency of public expenditure. A financial allocation formula
adjusted for poverty, morbidity patterns population size and population density will be developed for
allocations to districts. A review of national experience with user fees (and the application of exemptions),
community insurance and the community drug program will be finalized, and lessons derived to design
interventions for future scaling up.

Drugs, supplies & equipment (KfW, WHO) The program will support decentralization of authority to
purchase drugs and medical supplies to districts, while ensuring value and quality through the MOH
Logistics Management Division (LMD). LMD will prioritize ensuring availability of Essential Health Care
Services (EHCS) commodities and equipment, and will outsource distribution. A Logistics Management
Information System will be enabled to support local-level decision making. Lastly, the management of
medical waste will be addressed per the Medical Waste Management Plan which has been produced.

Human Resource Development (GTZ, WHO): As Local Bodies assume responsibility for health staff at
district level they will acquire new skills in personnel management, and a level of authority to modify
compensation in order to attract staff to underserved areas. Staff opinion surveys will be conducted to
assess morale and motivation and to help diagnose administrative, technical and managerial work practices
that impede staff utilization and efficiency.

Monitoring & Evaluation (UNFPA, USAID, IDA): A `reporting needs analysis' will be carried out aimed
at identifying what management decisions can be enhanced by the availability of regular information, and
what regular reports can be generated automatically by the various data banks and sent to the managers for
use in daily operations. Household and facility surveys will stratify results by socio-economic status to
instill a greater appreciation for addressing differences of utilization and coverage among socially excluded
groups.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

Comments:

The safeguard policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) is triggered requiring the project to
undertake an Environmental Assessment of the program. The program aims at improving access and
delivery of health services to the poor, marginalized communities, davits, anabatic and women. Due to the
type and nature of activities involved in the program, mostly designed to improve the health care service
delivery through decentralization and capacity building, the likelihood of other safeguard policies being
triggered is expected to be very low. Safeguard policy on environmental Assessment is expected to be
largely applicable to the healthcare waste (HCW) management components to be implemented as part of
the overall health sector program.

Section II ­ Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01): The program being supported by the Bank does not envisage
any significant construction activities. However, the program does involve up-gradating of some existing
health facilities and services that have the potential to generate health care waste, which if not managed
properly, can pose risks to both people and environment. The environmental assessment (EA) undertaken
for the health sector program identifies improper health care waste (HCW) management as the critical
environmental issue posing risks to both people and environment. A comprehensive review of the HCW
management in the country attributes the poor HCW management practices, as observed in most of the
healthcare facilities surveyed, to the absence of a specific regulation. The Environmental Protection Act
does not deal with HCW management issues. The study establishes an urgent need to introduce appropriate
regulation on HCW management.




*
 By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties'
claims on the disputed areas

Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12): Based on the SA team's review findings, the program will not
entail any involuntary resettlement or land acquisition, therefore, the OP/BP 4.12 does not applied.

Indigenous People (OD 4.20): Social Assessment (SA) has determined that the project will not have any
negative impact on indigenous people or those from socially disadvantaged communities such as Davits
and Anabatic. However, HMGN has carried out a Vulnerable Communities Development Plan (VCDP) to
ensure that the requirements of OD 4.20 are operationally reflected in the design of the project. The
findings and recommendations of the have been integrated in the VCDP. The recommended actions are
disaggregated at various levels: national, district and local with a view to streamlining the program's policy
reform objective, strategies and outcomes that will result in an effective and inclusive national health
services program.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area.

The present practice of HCWM in the country is very poor barring few piecemeal efforts to improve the
situation. A few health care facilities have taken steps towards implementing comprehensive waste
handling and management system, including use of needle destroyers and color-coded containers for waste
disposal but at most of the health care facilities the waste management is still far from common
international standard. In some cases the practices being followed were reported to be unsatisfactory.
There is a need for urgent action in terms of policy, regulation and strategy supported by a time bound
action plan to improve HCWM practices in the country.

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)

D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

In order to improve the HCW management in the country, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has developed a
strategy and an Action Plan. The MOH has recently submitted a proposal to the government to enact a
regulation on HCW management. Increasing awareness, introducing regulation and encouraging private
sector participation form the broad part of the strategy to deal with the HCW management issues. Indicative
institutional arrangement for implementation of the Action Plan has been proposed. It is recognized that
substantial capacity building at various levels of the MOH as well as other stakeholders would be required
to be undertaken to implement the Action Plan. Therefore a synchronized capacity building program has
been outlined. In order to monitor the implementation of the Action Plan as well as the resulting
environmental benefits a monitoring plan has been developed.

MOH would need to include HCW management as a distinct (sub)activity and make appropriate budget
allocation for it in the overall health budget. Separate budget allocation would mean that funds earmarked
for HCW management is not used elsewhere, and should induce accountability on the respective agencies
involved in HCW management.

Based on the findings and recommendations of a social assessment study, the Government has prepared a
draft Vulnerable Communities Development Plan (VCDP) which is taking into account the results of the
consultation with stakeholders. It would facilitate compliance with OD 4.20 and ensure that the program
provides the necessary measures to insure that indigenous people get equal access to project benefits.
Measures include: (I) introducing language program in areas where there are large populations of
indigenous people or linguistic minorities who do not speak Nepali as their mother tongue; (ii) providing
incentives for recruitment of local bilingual women nurses and doctors (iii) disaggregating health care data
by gender, caste, ethnicity and special needs; and (iv) enabling partnerships between the HMC and local
community groups.

Nepal's institutional capacity for strategic planning, policy development, resource mobilization and
coordination of external donors and national stakeholder is limited. The project will be promoting a sector-
wide operation, as such there will be challenges and opportunities for building capacity. In this context, in

order to effectively implement the VDCP, it will be necessary to establish:

     i)        policy directives for increased social diversity in staff;
     ii)       capacity building for improved attitude behaviour and skills towards women, janajatis and
               dalits;
     iii)      more effective partnerships with NGOs for improved responsiveness to vulnerable
               communities and their social exclusion from health services.

At present the Government does not have the required capacity to implement the VDCP and HCWM
Action Plan. The SA, VCDP, EA have therefore recommended a capacity building program (to be fine
tuned as part of the larger capacity building program for the program implementation) for various
Government agencies to be involved in the implementation of the VCDP and the HCWM activities. In the
long run, it is expected that the Government agencies would only play a facilitating role while the private
agencies, NGOs and CBOs are expected to take a lead in performing the actual tasks.

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Community consultation is an integral part of the overall program. The local communities and institutions
are involved in identification, planning, design, implementation, operation and maintenance of the Health
Post/Sub-Health Post (HP/SHP) and all other program activities. Consultations with health professionals,
nurses, Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs), experts, NGOs, CBOs and other stakeholders will
continue throughout the implementation period. During the review of current HP/SHPs construction
activities, as part of the EA, consultations were held with health professionals, and CBOs/NGOs. Meetings
were also held with several stakeholders including the experts from the department of environment and
health. The draft environmental assessment was discussed with Government, relevant local authorities and
NGOs, and the comments have been incorporated in the EA. The HMGN has disclosed the EA and the
VCDP and other supporting documents on their website, as well as in public places for wider dissemination
project documents.
