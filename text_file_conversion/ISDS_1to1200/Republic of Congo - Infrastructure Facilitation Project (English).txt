B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The development objectives of the project are to improve the quality of and expand access to reliable 
water and electricity services, and to promote the efficient use of biomass resources.   These efforts would 
include:   
\01\02
Increasing quality of electricity service in urban and rural areas, primarily by rehabilitating 
priority installations that constrain power delivery and thereby impede industrial and social 
development.  The activities would be focused on Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, but would also 
include other isolated urban centers and certain small-scale rural projects. 
\01\02
Increasing access to reliable potable water services by rehabilitating production and storage 
capacity, notably in Brazzaville. 
\01\02
Improving the efficiency of the water and power utilities, in part by injecting some private sector 
management. 
\01\02
Strengthening the Ministry’s management and planning functions with regard to water and 
electricity, as well as the operational capacity of the specialized rural electrification agency, and 
rationalizing the respective roles of sectoral actors. 
\01\02
Improving management of biomass resources, supporting sustained efficient fuelwood 
production, and promoting alternative energy sources. 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The project has two main components, Energy and Water. The energy component (totaling about $35 
million) in turn is divided into: 
 
(a) A larger power sector component, that includes the following. 
 
Page  2
 
 
\01\02
Rehabilitation of physical infrastructure
, primarily in transmission and distribution, and, to a 
lesser extent, generation.  The project will repair key transmission (e.g., the Brazzaville/Pointe 
Noire link), and reinforce, upgrade, and expand the distribution systems in Brazzaville, Pointe 
Noire and improve reliability of isolated systems in numerous smaller urban centers.  [$20 M.] 
\01\02
Capacity building
 support to the Ministry, to SNE, to ANER (the newly created rural 
electrification agency), and to the Electricity Regulatory Agency (ERA) regarding their planning, 
management and operational functions.  Activities to be financed would include a tariff study 
(both for on-grid and off-grid (isolated) systems) and development of an electrification master 
plan (GIS based).  The component would also: (i) finance the acquisition of logistical support 
inputs (including equipment), (ii) finance the purchase of meters, and (iii) support the bidding 
process for a management contract to handle billing/collection for SNE in Brazzaville as a step to 
improving the financial viability of the electricity sector; consideration would be given during 
project preparation to expanding the scope of the contract to include all distribution activities in 
Brazzaville. [$8 M, of which $3 M for institutional support and $5 M for equipment and meters.] 
\01\02
Development of a small-scale rural electrification/renewable energy program
 (e.g., two 500 kW 
systems; potential for PV use for rural clinics).  [$3 M.] 
\01\02
Support to the PEAC secretariat, the secretariat to the newly established Central African Power 
Pool
, headquartered in Brazzaville.  [$0.5 M.] 
 
(b) A smaller component would address the issue of biomass
, an important issue in a country with 
large forestry resources. [$5 M.]  This will be done through the implementation of the following 
activities: 
 
\01\02
Survey on wood energy consumption in main urban centers in the south, and forest inventory in 
forests located around Brazzaville. 
\01\02
Feasibility studies (a) of a Brazzaville fuel supply project, and (b) for the establishment of 
community forests in the Departments of Pool, Plateaux and Buenza. 
\01\02
Study on the use of forest residues during wood harvesting and around forest enterprises.  
\01\02
Promotion and diffusion of about 40,000 wood saving stoves, and of LPG using small bottles. 
\01\02
Elaboration of land reallocation plans, and of energy “bilans” from 1995 to 2003. 
\01\02
Institutional strengthening of the General Direction of Forest Economy, Direction of Energy, and 
the National Division of Inventory and Forest and Wildlife Management. 
  
The water component (totaling about $15 M) would focus in on: 
 
\01\02
Rehabilitation of physical infrastructure
 (production and storage capacity, the laboratory and the 
meter testing facility) in Brazzaville and possibly Pointe Noire, and full scale metering (including 
acquisition of meters) in Brazzaville; strengthening the management of the urban water sector 
through the introduction of a global management contract (covering, e.g., technical, commercial 
and financial operations) and implementing a tariff policy to reach financial equilibrium of the 
urban water sector.  
\01\02
Capacity building
 support to the Ministry in regulating and monitoring the management 
contract; devising an appropriate tariff policy and capacity building for SNDE’s staff in 
technical, commercial and financial operations. 
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
 
Page  3
 
 
The project will operate primarily in the urban areas of  Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, as well as at 
various points along the corridor (such as Tsielampo).  Other urban centers where some rehabilitation 
activites are being considered include:  Owanda, Makoua, Oyo, Mossaka, Boundji, Djambala, Lekana, 
Gamboma, Abala, Impfondo, Bongou, Epena and Ouesso.  Other areas for possible small scale rural 
interventions will be evaluated as part of project preparation and during initial project implementation. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
 
The Borrower’s institutional capacity for safeguard policies will be evaluated during project preparation, 
as part of the EA process, and will build on the Borrower’s compliance under the ongoing emergency 
rehabilitation and other projects currently under implementation.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A. 
Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS would be prepared. 
 
The QER is targeted for October 20, 2004. 
 
B. 
For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage ISDS

C. 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  The specific 
studies and their timing
1
 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
An environmental assessment should be completed by October 2004.  Environmental management and 
resettlement policy frameworks would be prepared to guide action for activities to be identified during 
project implementation.  The documentation would be disclosed in-country.  It is currently anticipated 
that the documents would be disclosed at the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water, as well as at 
regional/local government offices and/or other public buildings (e.g. libraries) in Brazzaville, Point Noire, 
and other key locations (to be decided based in part on the locations of project activities), as well as in the 
World Bank office in Brazzaville and at the InfoShop.
