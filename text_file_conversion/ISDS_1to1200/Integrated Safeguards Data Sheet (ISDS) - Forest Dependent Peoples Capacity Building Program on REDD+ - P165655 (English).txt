                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase the capacities of forest dependent peoples to participate in
                           REDD+ processes and policies.

                           C. Project Description
                           The Forest Dependent Peoples Capacity Building Program on REDD+ Project will be financed through a US$
                           750,000 Grant from the FCPF Capacity Building Program, and implemented by the Central African Forests
                           Commission (COMIFAC), which is located in Cameroon.

                           Financed activities will be grouped into the following three components:

                           Component 1: Strengthening the Participation of Forest Dependent Peoples in REDD+ Policies (US$ 0.5
                           million)

                           Sub-component 1a: Capacity Building and Improvement of Governance at National Level (US$ 0.3 million)



                         Mar 07, 2018                                                                                                      Page 2 of 5

                                  Forest Dependent Peoples Capacity Building Program on REDD+




                           Sub-component 1a will support capacity building activities and the improvement of governance of forest
                           dependent peoples' organizations in each of the five FCPF eligible countries. The objective is to obtain the
                           validation of national operationalization plans for the implementation of REPALEAC's strategic framework
                           2018-2025. These plans will be developed through national and local level activities with representatives of
                           REPALEAC's national networks. In addition, when relevant, capacity building activities will be financed in the
                           areas impacted by REDD+ investments (Emission Reduction Program areas) to enhance participation of local
                           organization and the emergence of local leaders.

                           Implementation Arrangement: This sub-component will be executed under the responsibility of COMIFAC,
                           with the possibility for COMIFAC to subcontract or sign MOUs with REPALEAC's national network in each
                           country, for the execution of a list of activities.

                           Sub-Component 1b: Capacity Building and Improvement of Governance at Regional Level (US$ 0.2 million)

                           Sub-component 1b will strengthen REPALEAC's institutional and organizational capacities to become a
                           capable coordination body and the main counterpart for REDD+ consultations related to forest dependent
                           peoples in the Congo Basin. In particular, it will help REPALEAC (i) convene regional workshops to evaluate,
                           aggregate, and coordinate the national operationalization plans, (ii) effectively report at the international
                           level on the participation of FDPs in the various national REDD+ processes based on the feedback from the
                           country-level constituents and (iii) set up an effective sub-regional coordination of FDPs activities related to
                           REDD+ in Central Africa including arbitration, conflict resolution, and dissemination of lessons learned.

                           Implementation arrangement: Sub-component 1b will be executed by COMIFAC, as a fiduciary agent, in
                           coordination with REPALEAC, which would be in a steering role.

                           Component 2: Knowledge Management and Program Coordination (US$ 0.25 million)

                           Sub-component 2a: Knowledge Management (US$ 0.1 million)

                           This sub-component will focus on the facilitation of knowledge exchange and management at the regional
                           level between Anglophone and Francophone countries, if possible targeting the local leaders identified in the
                           REDD+ programs areas. This will be achieved through regional activities with MPIDO and PACJA.

                           Sub-component 2b: Program Coordination (US$ 0.15 million)

                           This component will finance the overhead costs of the COMIFAC team that will manage the project during
                           the 18-month project duration. Project management includes procurement, financial management,
                           environmental and social safeguard compliance assurance, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and reporting,
                           and preparation of annual work plans and budgets acceptable to the World Bank. This component will also
                           finance an annual audit of the project account by an external auditor and any costs related to the execution
                           of a grievance redress mechanism. M&E will take place at the project and national levels in accordance with
