NISCO commissioned         Nanjing Land Development             Center (NLDC) of Nanjing         Land Bureau to

carry out land acquisition     and resettlement for      the project. NLDC is       assigned by the land     bureau

to specifically address    all land acquisition   issues caused by government-financed              projects and it

is very experienced in    implementing resettlement          programs in compliance        with national and

local laws and regulations.      Land acquisition and       resettlement were      commenced in December

2001 and completed      it in three months. No      major outstanding issue         has been found during

Bank's May mission.       Nonetheless, since both        NISCO and NLDC had           no experience with World

Bank-assisted projects     before, their institutional     capacity for managing       resettlement programs        in

compliance with World       Bank resettlement      policy is limited.
