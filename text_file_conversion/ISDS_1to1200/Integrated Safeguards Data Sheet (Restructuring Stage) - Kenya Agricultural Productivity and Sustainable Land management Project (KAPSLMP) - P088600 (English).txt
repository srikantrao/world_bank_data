                         critical ecosystem functions and structures.
                         3. Project Description
                         The proposed project has four components:
                          (a)      Building capacity for SLM: This component recognizes the critical need for capacity at
                         multiple levels for the implementation of the objectives of the project andseeks to address these gaps.
                         It will target communities and service pro                                   viders for training and
                         capacity enhancement as well as help build a broader awa                                      reness of
                         the potential and impact of SLM.
                          (b)      (Investments in community SLM micro-projects: This component will support community

                         micro-projects. The micro-projects to be supported will be identified
                         within the micro-catchment plans developed by communities to address land degrad
                         ation and/or provide alternate means of livelihoods using a Community Driven Dev
                         elopment (CDD) approach.
                          (c)      Strengthening the enabling policy and institutional environment for SLM: This component
                         will strengthen the enabling environment necessary for mainstreamin
                         g sustainable land management approaches through the policy and institutional la
                         ndscape. It will seek to address gaps i n the policy framework, provide support
                         for institutional capacity for cross-sectoral integrated planning of and monitor
                         ing SLM interventions. It will also support improved coordination between agenc
                         ies. Importantly, it will facilitate the evolution towards a national SLM progr
                         am by developing a programmatic approach in the short-term. This component will
                         also pilot the implementation of Payments for Environmental Services (PES) mecha
                         nism in watershed of the rivers that supply water to the Sasumua Water Treatment Plant operated by
                         the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company. The main outputs of PES pilot willbe (i) a functioning
                         PES program in the catchments serving the Sas umua Reservoir, with payments and recurring costs
                         financed by the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company; (ii) lessons for the implementation of PES
                         programs in Ken        ya and other African countries, and a specific replication strategy for Kenya.
                          (d)      Coordination, monitoring and evaluation of project activities: The implementation period for
                         the proposed project is six years. This component will suppor                                  t project

                         will also coordinate the activities related to project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) as well as
                         impact assessment.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Initially, five catchments/operational areas (Ops) were selected but two catchments (Tugen Hills and
                         Yala) were dropped during the Bank?s Quality Enhancement Re
                         view (QER) meeting that was held at the World Bank in June 2007. This decision w
                         as based on the need to concentrate the project activities on a few areas for ma
                         ximum impact. Furthermore, the two dropped catchments are covered by other on-go
                         ing Bank supported projects; Western Kenya Community Driven Development &Flood M
                         itigation Project (WKCCD/FM), Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Proj
                         ect (WKIEMP), as well as the proposed Lake Victoria Environmental Management Pro
                         ject (LVEMP II). The KAPSLM project now covers the following three catchments/OP
                         s: Cherangani, Kikuyu-Kinale and Taita-Taveta
                          .
                          The three OPs are of high ecological and bio-physical importance and they face high erosion and
                         land degradation hazards that are closely linked to high poverty
                         prevalence. Apart from their bio-physical and ecological importance, these OPs
                         were selected to maximize overlap with KAPP operational areas. The OPs cover a t
                         otal of 11 administrative districts, half of which are KAPP operational district
                         s.

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01): This Policy is applicable given the project?s emphasis on
                              agricultural productivity and sustainable land management, spannin
                              g three watersheds. The project?s objective is the adoption of SLM practices and
                              technologies to mitigate land degradation and achieve greater productivity of c
                              rops, trees and livestock; and to adopt sustainable alternative livelihood optio
                              ns to diversify and increase income, and reduce the pressure on the natural reso
                              urces. Any potential adverse environmental impacts on environmentally important
                              areas or on human populations are limited, and can be mitigated. The borrower
                              has prepared an ESMF to ensure that all environmental issues are considered duri
                              ng project planning, implementation and monitoring. All sub-project will be give
                              n an environment category. If a subproject is of category A in nature, a separat
                              e EA will need to be prepared and disclosed, before subproject implementation. T
                              he screening process will also identify if any subprojects will need EMPs. Forma
                              t for both EA and EMP are included in the ESMF. The subproject cannot be finally approved and
                              funded until the EA/EMP is approved and disclosed. The micro-proje ct screening criteria and
                              intuitional arrangements through district environment committee (DEC) was agreed upon as part
                              of ESMF..

                              (wetlands, forest and grassland fragments) for biodiversity conservation. The project will focus on
                              conservati on strategies and hence there will be no degradation or conversion of natural ha bitats.
                              Other project activities are not expected to negatively impact critical habitats directly or indirectly.
                              The ESMF provides communities and extension t eams with the appropriate checklist tools,
                              resource sheets and planning methods to identify any potential impacts of subprojects on natural
                              habitats, reserves, or protected areas, and to develop appropriate mitigation measures to minimize
                              o r avoid damage, or compensate for it. Those activities that are not addressed b y the ESMF and
                              that may have impacts on natural habitats will be identified usin g the screening and review
                              procedures as outlined in chapter 6 of the ESMF.
                               Forests (OP 4.36): This policy is triggered by the project. With the recent passage of the Forest
                              Act, Kenya is advocating a major shift away from exclusive gov ernment conservation and
                              management of forest resources. The Act emphasizes co-m anagement by local communities and
                              private sector for the protection and sustain                   able use of forests. The Kenya NRM
                              Project (P095050) that was approved by the Bo                        ard during March 2007 will help
                              operationalize the Act, through the Ministry of               Environment and Natural Resources

                         introduction of invasive species and impacts from micr o-projects such as farm forestry or
                         agroforestry, small scale woodlots and tree              nurseries, apiculture, etc. in the KAPSLM
                         project, will be addressed through imp lementation of the ESMF. Relevant training is also
                         included in the training program for the various stakeholders and included in the overall project
                         cost tables .
                          Pest Management (OP 4.09): Pesticide use among communities in the project areas is low to non-
                         existent. However, some subprojects such as establishment of tre                 e nurseries;
                         establishment of fenced pastures to restore natural vegetation; agr oforestry for soil fertility
                         replenishment and improved crop production; and, in troduction of improved fallows, may include
                         the use of some fertilizers and pest            icides. Hence the Pest Management Policy is
                         triggered. The requirement to scre en for pesticide use is included in the screening checklist
                         process as outlined            in chapter 6. Additionally, the borrower has prepared a brief
                         Integrated Pest M             anagement Plan (IPM) which will be implemented during the project.
                         The project            also includes specialized training in IPM as well as pesticides/insecticides
                         con          tainer management. Depending on the nature of the subproject, the screening proc ess
                         will identify the need for the preparation of a separate Pest Management Pla                n (PMP).
                         Such a PMP should be prepared and disclosed before the subproject is ap proved and funded.
                         Relevant training is also included in the training program fo         r the various stakeholders and
                         included in the overall project cost tables

                          Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10): There are two tribal groups in the project areas that according to
                         OP 4.10 would be characterized as Indigenous Peoples and thus                              the policy is
                         triggered. These groups in the Cherangani Hills and the Kinale-Kik uyu catchments are
                         marginalised and social discriminated peoples in their respec                      tive areas. These
                         indigenous peoples face similar problems whether they are hunt er-gatherers or semi-pastoralists.
                         During project preparation it became clear th                 at the project might impact on indigenous

                         peoples? rights, lands, livelihoods an      d culture. Given the community driven nature of
                         KAPSLM project, it is not clear now which micro-project will impact the groups, therefore GoK
                         prepared an Indige         nous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF). If through the screening
                         process a micro       -project has been identified to have Indigenous Peoples present in, or to have c
                         ollective attachment to, the micro-project area, then the IPPF must be referred to and individual
                         Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) prepared and disclosed. The IPPF outlines the relevant steps
                         required in order to ensure that appropriate measur es are put in place to safeguard the rights of
                         affected communities.
                          Safety of Dams (OP 4.37): The policy is not triggered by project activities. It is planned that the
                         Payment for Environmental Services (PES) pilot will be impl emented in the watershed of rivers
                         (Chania and Kiburu) that supply water to the                     Sasumua Water Treatment Plant
                         operated by Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company. T                           he Project will establish
                         appropriate institutional arrangements to mediate tran sactions between service users (farmers in
                         the watershed) and providers (NWSC),                     at acceptable transaction costs. The Project is
                         facilitating the contract proces                s between NWSC and the voluntary land users which
                         will enable them to make appro                   priate land use changes that will reduce
                         sedimentation in the reservoir. The pro                ject will finance: (i) technical studies to identify
                         sedimentation problems in t           he Sasumua Reservoir and contamination problems in the two
                         rivers; (ii) socio-ec onomic evaluation of upstream areas to identify the specific land users who
                         manage the land from which sedimentation problems originate, as well as the constrai nts they

                           face in making land use decisions. The project will not fund any subpr ojects that will use water
                           from the reservoir. The PES component will enable the farmers upstream to practice appropriate
                           land uses that will result in reduced sedimentation in the reservoir, thereby increasing

                            Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4 .12): The policy is not triggered by project activities. Project will
                           not finance any activities that will trigger the policy. Pro ject activities will not entail in physical
                           relocation and displacement of peopl                     e or loss of land and/or other assets. The
                           project will not restrict access to l ivelihood. The alternative livelihoods proposed within
                           communities for implementation will also not trigger the policy. The screening checklist for
                           subprojects in the ESMF includes relevant questions with regards to this policy. If any subp
                           roject anticipates land acquisition, or a potential for the policy to be trigger              ed, the
                           subproject will not be approved.

                            Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11): The policy is not triggered by project activities. However,
                           the requirement to screen for physical cultural resources and        chance finds is included in
                           the process set out in the ESMF.

                            Safeguard Policies on Projects in International Waterways (OP 7.50) and Projects in Disputed

                           in the project area:
                            Since Indigenous Peoples are part of the project beneficiaries, project activities will benefit them
                           and help in improving their livelihoods, while strengthenin                                    g their

                             All subproject activities will be subjected to environmental and social screening, as described in
                           the safeguards reports. These procedures will allow subprojec                                      t

                           mpacts. As necessary, some subprojects might require specific environmental mana
                           gement plans (EMP) or pest management plans (PMP) to be prepared before implemen
                           tation of subprojects. All subprojects will be given an environment category. If
                           a subproject is of category A in nature, a separate EA will need to be prepared
                           and disclosed, before subproject implementation. Format for an EA is included i
                           n the ESMF.

                         (                                    ICC), which consists of the sector Permanent Secretaries. The
                         KAPSLM-SC will be                                         in charge of the work programming for the
                         project, and will be composed of seni                                     or staff from the relevant

                         at (KS) will be expanded with recruitment of some new expertise, including envir
                         onmental and social expertise, who will be responsible for overall safeguards is
                         sues.
                          Among other roles, the KS will coordinate project activities at the national level and at the three
                         catchments, by guiding and overseeing the activities of the                          Catchment Area
                         Coordinators (see below). They will implement a monitoring system that is integral to each
                         activity and is effectively linked to planning for per            iodic adjustments in activities,
                         when necessary; and will evaluate the project, including community evaluations, to ensure
                         effective implementation.
                          A Catchment Area Coordinator (CAC), will be appointed for each catchment, who will be based
                         in the existing KAPP District Service Unit, DSU; except for the Kiku                    yu-Kinale
                         catchment, which does not fall under the KAPP operational area. Here,            the CAC would be
                         located in the KS, located at KARI headquarters in Nairobi. Th                     e CAC will monitor

                         officers (DDO, PDO, DEO, PDE) in order to imple ment broader program activities. The CAC
                         will work closely and be assisted by K                 APP DSU Coordinator, the M&E officer and
                         other officers in the DSU.
                          Public and private service providers including CBOs, NGOs, extension teams and others, will be
                         trained to work with communities in designing, developing and imp lementing micro-projects that
                         are consistent with the micro-watershed plans and meet the criteria set out in the PIP. They will
                         also be trained to use the scree ning checklist in the ESMF to screen micro-project. Additionally,
                         any micro-pro jects that have a potential to trigger the OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement, will
                         not be approved. If a micro-project requires environmental or social mitiga tion measures, then an
                         EMP or PMP will be prepared and attached along with the p roposal before it is submitted for
                         approval. If a micro-project is of category A in nature, an EA will be prepared by a NEMA-

                           beneficiaries in two operational areas, and the project will address issues in its area of influence.
                           During the proposed project preparation it wasagreed that most of the national and policy related
                           issues identified in the IPP               F will be supported by the IDA supported NRM project.
                           The proposed KAPSLM will o nly support IPPF activities specific to the operational areas. The
                           NRM Project w ill address key issues regarding IP and other forest-dependent communities in Ke
                           nya: It will harmonize the forest policy with the draft land policy, implement a participatory forest
                           management, support the elaboration of a comprehensive res ettlement policy and rehabilitate in
                           the operational areas (Aberdares, Upper Tan a, Kakamega, Mt Elgon as well as the Nandi and
                           Cherengani hills) the livelihoods of populations, which have been evicted from forests after the
                           new Government w as sworn in December 30, 2002. The project will ensure: (a) that present and
                           p ast settlements, land use areas and cultural sites of IP are comprehensively doc umented; (b) that
                           the IP are well represented in all forest and resettlement rel ated decision-making bodies and
                           processes; (c) that a comprehensive strategy to rehabilitate the livelihoods of evicted IP is
                           elaborated in an open-minded and f ully participatory option assessment; and (d) that this strategy
                           is implemented in a comprehensive and timely manner and that the IP are enabled to benefit from
                           participatory forest management and reforestation. Given the broad-based suppor t of IP under
                           NRM, the proposed KAPSLMP will support capacity building to implement the IPPF,
                           participatory M&E system and IP inclusion in project activities. T                                   he
                           project has set aside US$600, 000 for IPPF and ESMF related activities. Once
                           proposals are presented by the indigenous communities, the micro-projects will
                           be formulated following the guidelines of OP 4.10 (Annex B) concerning preparati
