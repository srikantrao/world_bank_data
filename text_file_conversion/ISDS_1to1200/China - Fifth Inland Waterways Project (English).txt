A.2. Project Objectives
* Waterway users along the Han River will benefit from cost-effective, predictable, and
increased transport capacity.
* The Xiangfan City Area and the Tandong Farmland Region will use sustainable
hydropower and water resources.
A.3. Project Description
The project has two components:
Cuijiaying Navigation and Power Complex (total US$200.4 million, IBRD US$99.1 million)
* Construction of a shiplock. dam, and power station, and installation of auxiliary facilities.
The power station and the shiplock will be near the west bank of the river. The shiplock
will be a Class IlI in accordance with the Chinese lock classification and capable of
accommodating vessels up to 1,000 ton capacity with an effective chamber of 180 x 23 x
3.5m. The dam will provide a weighted average head of 6.6m (design head 5.5m). The
power station will have an installed capacity of 96 MW (from 6 bulb turbines each of
16MW capacity) with a mean annual generation of 439 GWh. The power plant will be
connected to the grid for Xiangfan Prefecture by a 1 10 kV transforner at the Qianying
sub-station, less than I km from the dam.
* Construction of dam site access road and bridges: A short (0.3 kin long) road and two
short bridges will connect the power house and shiplock to the west bank.
. Reservoir bank protection: The banks of the reservoir will be strengtlhened to ensure their
stability, thereby protecting the adjoining farmlands and village settlements from flooding.
In all 30 km of embankment will be reinforced, the total area of slope protection will be
19.3 ha.
Institutional Development (US$7.9 million, IBRD US$0.37 million)
The systems, institutions, and processes needed to implement the Cuijiaying complex need
strengthening. The project will assist through technical assistance programs in the following
areas:
* Capacity building ($870,000) will be provided to the project implementing agencies
through technical assistance, training and study tours.



* Studies will be carried out on (a) the Han River long-term development planning
(US$120,000), (b) the development of integrated hiiglhway and waterway tranisport
(US$120,000). and (c) power pricing and management (US$150,000).
* Equipment (US$6.68 million) will be provided.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevanit to the safeguaard analysis:
1. The complex is a rLin-of-river type dam with a maximiLUl height of 1 8m and about 2.1 km in
length. It is located 17 km downstream of Xiangfan City. the second largest city in Hubei
Province. The reservoir will extend 40 km upstream beyond the city and its norimial capacity
will be 285 million m3. The area to be inundated will be limited to the present seasonally
flooded area (98 ha).
2. The Han River Development Plan envisages 16 cascading dams on the river, among which 9
are in Hubei Province and 7 are in Shaanxi Province. In Hubei Province, two dams have
already been constructed and the Cuijiaying complex will be the third. Tlhe Ctijiaying
complex is independent from other dams in terms of engineering and economics. One of the
existing dams, Danjiangkou, is located 142 km upstream of Cuijiaying and its reservoir is
being enlarged and will be 1 00-times larger than Cuij iaving's. Accordingly, the design of the
Cuijiaying complex will take into account the new hydraulic conditions that will be created
by the big Danjiangkou Dam.

Section I} - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.l. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Environment:
Since the complex is a run-of-river type dam, the major issue during construction is control of
water pollution by suspended solids and that during operation is separation of habitats of
aquatic species. The latter one is irreversible but not on a large scale.
Social:
The main adverse social impact of the project is year-round flooding of land within the river
banks that today is flooded during only a few [summerl months and is cultivated during the
rest of the year. Houses will be limited to the darn construction site. Project construction
would also affect some public facilities, business and factories. Due to the run-off nature of
the reservoir, low productivity of the river bank land and the low percentage of land loss in
each affected family, the land loss impacts on the livelihoods of the affected population are
estinated to be limited. The social assessment also confirms that there are no ethnic minority
communities to be affected by the project
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated futLre
activities in the project area.
Environment:
As noted above, the Cuijiaying Complex will be the third in a planned cascade of 16 dams.
The EIA analyses the cumulative impacts of the planned nine dams in Hubei Province and
identifies hydraulic impacts as the major impact. They are a mix of large reservoir-type
dams, which would cause major impacts to hydrology, and run-of-river type dams. which
would have little impact. Generally speaking, the impacts of separation of fish habitats to be
caused by those cascading dams would be limited because the distances between dams are
large enough for ordinary species, but some species that need habitats of greater river length
would be more seriously affected. However, practically speaking. there are no suchI species
(except for eels), as the Danjiangkou Dam was constructed in 1 960s.
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
During preparation of the project, several alternatives were examined in terms of location and
height of the dam as well as the Do-Nothing alternative. Minimizing the number of people
needing resettlement was the major factor in determining the location of the dam. The height
of the dam is not so influential on the environmental and social protection because all the
alternatives are below the natural flooding level.
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Environment
The borrower has made an Environment Action Plan (EAP). which includes a standard set of
mitigation measures that the EIA has recommended for this type of civil work. The borrower
has demonstrated its capacity to implement such EAPs through other Bank projects of
highway construction.
Social
A socioeconomic survey and a social assessment were conducted in the project areas. On the
basis of the above, a resettlement action plan has been developed in line with local laws,



policies and World Bank OP 4.12, with active participation of local governments and the
affected people. The RAP documents the impacts, the policy framework, the relocation
arrangements, and livelihood rehabilitation measures. The total resettlement budget is
estimated at RMB 266 million ($32.1 million).
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechianisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
A two-stage public consultation was carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
guideline: (a) shortly after environmental screening and before the terms of reference for the
EA were finalized (December 2003); and (b) after the draft EA report was prepared (April
2004). The consultation was conducted by meetings withi local people at project-affected
towns and surveys through questionnaires. Project-affected individuals, organizations of
concerned villagers, and village committees were intensively consulted. Tlhe major concerns
of the consulted people were related to resettlement. The EIA, EAP and RAP were disclosed
at the project site (Xiangfan City), and HPCD (Wuhan City) in December 2004 as well as
Infoshop in Washington D.C. in early January 2005.
