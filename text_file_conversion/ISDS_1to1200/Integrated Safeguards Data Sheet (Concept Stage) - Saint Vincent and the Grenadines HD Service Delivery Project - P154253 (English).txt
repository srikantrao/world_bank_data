                           B. Project Objectives
                           The Project development objective of the Project is to strengthen service delivery in education, social
                           protection, and labor.
                           C. Project Description
                           The Project will be structured around four components:

                           Component 1: Strengthening pedagogy for basic and special needs education and TVET teachers.
                           This Component will aim at strengthening the capacity of teachers to deliver quality education by: (i)
                           adapting the OECS teaching and learning standards developed at a regional level with support from
                           the GPE to the country level contexts of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, (ii) providing training on
                           effective pedagogical practices, formative assessment in line with the new learning standards and use
                           of student learning data to tailor teaching to students at different levels, (iii) printing and distribution
                           of teacher➢❨ s manuals and guidelines on effective pedagogical practices, (iv) establishing an on-
                           line community of practice on effective pedagogical practices, and (v) monitoring of teacher

                           classroom practices through the use of classroom observation instruments.

                           Component 2: Building Responsive Social Protection Service Delivery Systems. This component
                           will aim at strengthening service delivery systems for social safety nets, to ensure that programs and
                           services are more efficient, better tailored to beneficiary needs and vulnerabilities, and more
                           responsive to shocks and crises, through: (i) completing the design of, and operationalizing
                           instruments to support targeting, information management and referrals; (ii) capacity building to
                           administer and manage SSNs; and (iii) financing consultancies to strengthen the institutional
                           framework and overall policy for SSN programs.

                           Component 3: Strengthening Labor Market Systems and Improving Skills Training of Poor and
                           Vulnerable Populations. This Component will support country efforts to improve labor market
                           outcomes through strengthening the skills certification framework and providing training that is
                           responsive to market needs. In particular, it will: (i) strengthen the overall institutional and policy
                           framework for the labor market; (ii) update the knowledge base for training delivery; (iii) improve
                           the delivery of TVET education in schools; and (iv) provide direct delivery of training to poor
                           unemployed adults and youth.

                           Component 4: Project Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation. This Component would finance
                           activities related to the management of the Project to ensure its effective administration and
                           implementation, and develop and put in place an effective monitoring system. In particular the
                           Component would finance: (i) project coordination; (ii) external technical verifications and audits;
                           and (iii) the development and implementation of Project monitoring and evaluation systems for the
                           Project. Bank financing would support project management through financing part of the incremental
                           operating costs of the existing PCU, as well as training to project staff, purchase of necessary office
                           equipment, and independent project audits. The Project would also support the design and

                           implementation of tools to monitor the results framework for the proposed Project. Bank financing
                           would be provided for technical assistance, services and training of the staff engaged in monitoring.
                           Besides, the component will finance LCS data collection for an updated CPA.

                           No social safeguards are triggered by this project. Nevertheless, the Central Planning Division of the
                           Ministry of Finance has historically managed the social development and social safeguards-related
                           aspects of Bank-financed projects and the social team within Central Planning has the capacity and
                           experience to manage social-development related issues and associated consultations that might arise.
