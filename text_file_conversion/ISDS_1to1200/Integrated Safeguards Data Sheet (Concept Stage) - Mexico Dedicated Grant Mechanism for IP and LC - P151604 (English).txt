                           B. Project Objectives
                           The proposed Development Objective (PDO) of the project is to strengthen participation in decision-
                           making and planning processes related to FIP and REDD+ at the local, national and international
                           levels of forest-dependent people and to increase their capacities to manage community forests by
                           directly working with ejidos and local communities.
                           In the spirit of the DGM’s collaborative approach to design and implementation, the DGM Program
                           objective is consistent with the interests and aspirations of the IPLCs expressed in the DGM Design
                         Proposal and the DGM Framework Operational Guidelines. Likewise, the proposed PDO has an
                         overarching approach which leaves enough room to allow the selection of activities based on the
                         principle of demand-driven interventions and identified through an extensive participatory and

                         representative process which is the nature and essence of the DGM.
                         C. Project Description
                         The Mexico DGM project would be aligned with Mexico➢❨ s FIP Investment Plan. The Mexico
                         DGM will focus on the direct and underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation in
                         Mexico s REDD+ Early Action Areas: Oaxaca, the coastal watersheds of Jalisco and the YucatÃ¡n
                         Peninsula (Campeche, Yucatan and Quintana Roo). While FIP➢❨ s intervention are mainly focused
                         on enhancing the quality and quantity of the offer under CONAFOR➢❨ s programs and financial
                         services through public development banks and financial intermediaries, the DGM will complement
                         these efforts by directly supporting new and innovative (demand-driven) sustainable forest
                         management schemes and practices identified by ejidos and communities. Considering that
                         DGM➢❨ s contribution to the overall subsidies available to ejidos and communities is small, the
                         value added of the project will be to identify and pilot, under a participatory approach, initiatives that
                         better integrate IPLC➢❨ s needs, perspectives, and modalities of delivery and organization.
                         The DGM➢❨ s approach to identify interventions will support an extensive participatory and
                         representative process by: (i) enhancing informed participation of the local population in decision-
                         making processes; (ii) incorporating the interests of different local shareholders (including women,
                         young people, and landless people); and (iii) considering peoples➢❨ worldviews and traditional
                         knowledge when design policies, programs and/or projects. The following components have been
                         preliminarily discussed and proposed by representatives of key stakeholders (ejidos and
                         communities):
                         Component 1: Governance and Financing Mechanisms for Community Forestry Management (about
                         USD 3.6 million). This component would support a revolving fund and seed money to support the
                         implementation of demand-driven proposals from ejidos and communities within the following
                         thematic areas: (a) avoided deforestation and forest degradation through sustainable forest

                         management, (b) protection of environmental services; (c) enhancement of carbon stocks in forest
                         landscape, (d) agroforestry and sustainable use of non-timber products, (e) low carbon production
                         systems in agriculture, and (f) evolving towards and strengthening of enterprises associated with
                         appropriate social schemes.
                         Component 2: Capacity Building, Communication and Advocacy (about USD 1.5 million). This
                         component would support a focalized capacity-building plan for strengthening managerial skills and
                         technical knowledge required for community forest management. The component will: (i) provide
                         training and technological development to community and producers➢❨ organizations; (ii) facilitate
                         knowledge-exchange networks among forest-dependent people and community forest entrepreneurs;
                         (iii) support a communication strategy for reporting on project➢❨ s progress and outcomes, identify
                         and disseminate lessons learned to both internal and external audiences and interested parties. It
                         would promote spaces for sharing experiences or good practices related with the Project among
                         different community members and communities.
                         Component 3: Management, monitoring and evaluation (about USD 0.9 million). This component
                         would support activities that will increase the capacity of indigenous peoples and local communities
                         to oversee, monitor and evaluate project activities and to strengthen internal systems of social
                         control. The component would also cover the incremental costs in which the National Executing
                         Agency (NEA) (to be selected) would incur to implement the sub-projects to be selected under the
                         project.
                         Additionally the Mexico DGM will benefit from the Global DGM component on knowledge sharing
                         and networking on REDD+.
                         Expected outcomes. DGM activities will address the underlying economic causes of deforestation
                         and degradation by working directly with ejidos and local communities providing revolving funds

                         and seed money to support new and innovative (demand-driven) proposals within thematic areas.
                         The project will focus on some of the social causes of deforestation and degradation by strengthening
                         managerial skills and technical knowledge required for community forest management. Thus, the
                         project is expected to: (i) improve participation of forest-dependent communities in REDD+ related
                         processes; (ii) enhance ownership over community forest initiatives that they have identified and
                         participated in; and (iii) improve the access to information, knowledge, and skills needed to engage
                         in sustainable forest management and run community forest enterprises eventually on more sounding
                         business and entrepreneurial grounds.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The target area of the project includes the State of Oaxaca, the coastal watersheds in the State of
                         Jalisco and the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula. In this priority project target area, forestry remains a relevant
                         economic sector and about 7.3 million people live under the poverty line. Together, these states are
                         responsible for 12.9 percent of the country's timber production (5.9 million cubic meters) and 11.7
                         percent of its fuelwood and charcoal production (0.7 million cubic meters).
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The proposed Grant will be executed, by an implementing agency with relevant capacity on social
                         and environmental safeguards, which will be selected among a non-profit and non-governmental
                         organizations according to Terms of Reference to be develop in compliance with the DGM
                         guidelines.
                         It is worth noting that in the last decades, Mexico has demonstrated its commitment to combat
                         deforestationand forest degradation as well as conservation of biodiversity. It has promoted a number
                         of national strategies and regulatory adjustments to promote sustainable forest management, in
                         particular involvement the communities that live their livelihoods from natural resources. The

                         country's regulatory framework includes the General Sustainable Forest Development Law, a
                         General Climate Change Law and the Sustainable Rural Development Law and the preparing its
                         National REDD+ Strategy (ENAREDD+) in a progressive and participatory manner since 2010. In
                         addition, Mexico participates in many platforms of technical and financial support for REDD+, and
                         is one of the eight pilot countries for the Forest Investment Program (FIP) and a member of the UN-
                         REDD program.
                         The DGM project is aligned with Mexico's National Development Plan 2013-2018, which calls for
                         strengthening the national climate change policy to foster a competitive, sustainable, resilient and
                         low carbon economy, by promoting and encouraging the incorporation of timber and non-timber
                         surfaces with forestry potential as well as by strengthening the social capital and management
                         capabilities of ejidos located in forests and areas with high value for biodiversity conservation. It is
                         also consistent with Mexico's ENAREDD+, which main goals are to lower GHG emissions from
                         deforestation and forest degradation, conserve and increase forest carbon stocks while fostering
                         sustainable rural development and improving forest owners' livelihoods. The ENAREDD+ follows
                         principles of social inclusion and gender equality, based on (i) full and effective participation of
                         indigenous peoples and ejidos, (ii) respect to their rights, knowledge and social organization as well
                         as (iii) respect for the forms of land tenure as prerequisite for preserving forests, environmental
                         services and the country's enormous biodiversity.
                         For these programs the country has made environmental assessments of the forestry sector and have
                         developed a number of frameworks, plans and proved best practices instruments, that could be the
                           basis for the development of DGM environmental and social frameworks, and they have helped to
                           develop the capacity of communities that have participated in the programs.
