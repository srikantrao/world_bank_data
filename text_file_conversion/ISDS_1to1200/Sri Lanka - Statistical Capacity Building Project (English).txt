B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
1. 
The objective of this project is to build durable capacity in the Sri Lankan national statistical 
system including the DCS and other government agencies, research institutes and universities as 
well as private sector users and data generators. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
2. 
It is envisaged that the project will consist of the following key components; 
 
(I)  
Institutional Environment
:
Improving the legal framework governing the main players, 
their mandates and legal enforcement powers as well as the protection of confidentiality of 
information.  This component will revise the Statistics Act and other relevant legislation
1
.
It will 
establish a National Statistics Board that will set high level policy and govern the direction and 
functioning of the whole system as well as coordination between the various bodies.  This

Ordinance of 1956 (revision).

component will also examine options to allow the DCS to contract with other parts of government 
and/or the private sector to gather and compile ad hoc statistics of national priority. 
 
(II)  
Organizational strengthening
:
The DCS is the main government agency responsible for 
data collection and dissemination.  It is composed of 18 disparate technical and services divisions 
housed in eight haphazard locations in and around Colombo.  This project component will 
rationalize the structure and functions of the DCS.  It will review the current inventory of data 
reports, data gathering and processing procedures and implement best practice approaches to 
these areas, including optimal levels of decentralization.  This component will look at ways of 
strengthening the DCS branch offices in various ministries.  It will also update the dissemination 
function including the book store, website and associated functions. 
 
(III) 
Training and Capacity Building
:
Training and capacity building are required both on the 
supply and the demand side.  The DCS currently compiles several series using outmoded methods 
and the majority of staff have had little training opportunities in recent years.  On the demand side 
parliamentarians, journalists, government officials and members of civil society could all benefit 
from increased awareness of the power of evidence-based policy formulation.  This component 
will develop a sustainable program of training and capacity building for producers and users of 
statistics including on-the-job training, overseas courses, in-house training as well as joint courses 
with local and international universities. 
 
(IV) 
Physical Infrastructure
:
The DCS is currently hampered by its dispersion across Colombo 
in eight different locations.  Restricted availability of computers has reduced the capacity for data 
processing and limited networking has increased the time required and potential for errors in 
gathering and processing data from field locations.  This component will provide DCS with 
suitable accommodation, and computing hardware, software and cabling that will allow it to take 
advantage of current technologies to achieve its mandate. 
 
(V)  
Project Support Office
:
As this is a complex project that needs to be prepared and 
implemented within a short time frame, execution will be overseen by a small project office 
bringing in appropriate project management skills from the private sector.  It is envisaged that the 
project office will include a financial manager, procurement specialist and secretarial support and 
will cost no more than 5 percent of the total project resources. 
 
Methodology 
 
3. 
The project design will be based on a STATCAP Master Plan (SMP) which will evaluate the 
strengths and weaknesses of Sri Lanka’s statistical system and set out a medium-term strategy for 
creating the necessary capacity to produce comprehensive, quality and relevant economic and 
social data for policy and decision-making.  The SMP will be drafted during the project 
preparation. 
 
4. 
The identification mission revealed three key areas in which consulting expertise is required to 
complete the SMP; (i) IT, (ii) HR and (iii) physical construction.  Terms of Reference for 
consultants that are required in each of these three areas will be prepared by the task team in 
consultation with DCS.  It is expected that these consultants will be procured as soon as possible 
following the approval of the concept note. 
 
D.  Project location (if known)

5. 
The project will be located in Colombo and may include upgrades to the DCS field offices in 40 
locations across Sri Lanka.
