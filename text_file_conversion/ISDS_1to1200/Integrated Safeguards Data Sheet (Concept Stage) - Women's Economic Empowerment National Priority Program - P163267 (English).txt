                           analysis (if known)
                           The WEE-NPP will orient its programming towards poor and underserved Afghan women in both
                           the rural and urban parts of the country. Specifically, women targeted under this NPP will be those
                           that have not been able to benefit from past women➢❨ s empowerment programmes, which have
                           often targeted elite urban women. Beneficiaries will be identified and quantified for each component
                           and in each province. Additional beneficiary distinctions would include:

                           - Geographic: rural, peri-urban, urban, nomadic communities, IDPs and returnees,;
                           - Economic: self-employed women, women in business as employers and employees, un/
                           underemployed women, farm workers; and
                            - Social: rural and urban poor and underserved women, with a particular focus on impoverished,
                           women-headed households, households with women as income earners, and/or who are illiterate or
                           have limited education.
