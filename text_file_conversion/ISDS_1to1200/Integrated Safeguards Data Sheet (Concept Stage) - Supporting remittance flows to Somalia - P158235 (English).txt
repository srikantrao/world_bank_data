                           The project aims to tackle key challenges with the UK-Somalia remittance corridor until a sounder
                           financial system is in place in Somalia, and to accelerate and support the development of that
                           financial system. More specifically, this project is intended as an interim set of activities to support
                           the supervisory role of the Central Bank of Somalia. The activities will also support the Somali
                           Government’s plan on the formalization of the Somali financial sector. Over time, the project has
                           evolved to include both shorter-term and longer-term elements to strengthen the systems supporting
                           the flow of remittances to Somalia.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project aims to tackle key challenges with the UK-Somalia remittance corridor until a sounder
                           financial system is in place in Somalia, and to accelerate and support the development of that
                           financial system. More specifically, this project is intended as an interim set of activities to support
                           the supervisory role of the Central Bank of Somalia. The activities will also support the Somali
                           Government’s plan on the formalization of the Somali financial sector. Over time, the project has
                           evolved to include both shorter-term and longer-term elements to strengthen the systems supporting
                           the flow of remittances to Somalia. The proposed solution is to be dealt with in two phases:
                           1. Drafting and procurement phase: This phase will first involve technical assistance to the Somali
                           government for the drafting of regulations for the MTO sector and the procurement of the Trusted

                           Agent. As mentioned above, the World Bank will undertake the procurement of the TA (Bank
                           Execution on behalf of the Recipient) as opposed to a Trusted Agent hired by the FGS (Recipient
                           Executed procurement).

                           2. Implementation phase: The implementation phase can only be achieved once the drafting and
                           procurement phases have been completed. The key component in the implementation phase is the
                           work conducted by the Trusted Agent . In Somalia, this phase would focus on the MTOs that are
                           currently registered and/or licensed by the CBS.
