                           The project development objective (PDO) is to expand coverage of a unique identifying number and
                           improve targeting of social safety nets in the project area.
                            3. Project Description
                           The project aims to expand coverage of a unique identifying number and improve targeting of social
                           safety nets in the project area. By attaining these objectives, the project will lay important
                           foundations to improve governance and effectiveness of social service delivery and to develop a
                           more integrated and efficient system to allocate social transfers. The project will finance the

                         necessary to assure the proper use and sustainability of the NPR and SR. The project will also
                         finance the cost related to its management, institutional capacity building and training, incremental
                         operational costs resulting from day-to-day activities of the Project Management Unit, and the design
                         of an integrated information system for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). The links and
                         complementarities between components 1 and 2 and a detailed description of how the project fits

                         Annex 2, section D of the Project Appraisal Document.

                         The project will be implemented through three components and will use a traditional investment
                         financing approach combined with a results-based financing modality. The traditional investment
                         financing approach will finance the purchase of goods and services and will disburse against eligible
                         expenditures for activities set out in the project➢❨ s Procurement Plan (PP). The results-based
                         financing modality will be used for some activities in components 1&2 and will reimburse Eligible
                         Expenditure Programs (EEPs) conditioned on the achievement of Disbursement-Linked Indicators
                         (DLIs).
