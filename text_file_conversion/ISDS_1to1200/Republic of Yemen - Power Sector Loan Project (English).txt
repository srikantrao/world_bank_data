B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The objective of the project is to improve the efficiency and quality of electricity supply through: (i) 
financing of critical investments for the rehabilitation of existing power stations; de-bottlenecking of the 
transmission system; loss reduction programs and strengthening of the distribution systems and (ii) 
assisting with the implementation of sector reforms and capacity building and training.  The expected 
outcomes would include:  (i)  the further improvements in the efficiency of operations and financial 
position of the PEC; (ii) the further strengthening of corporate governance within PEC; and (iii) the start 
of the implementation of the new industry structure and regulatory framework.
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The specific component proposed for support from IDA are still to be determined, but could include:  
 
Investment component  (US$ 40 to 60 million) 
\01\02
The 60MW expansion of the Al Hiswa power station in Aden using the excess capacity of the 
current steam boilers.  (The Al-Hiswa plant can be operated with natural gas with only minor 
modifications) 
\01\02
The rehabilitation of Ras-Kathib, AlMukta and Al Hiswa steam power stations and a number of 
other existing diesel stations 
\01\02
The Mareb-Sana’a 400KV transmission line and associated substations 
\01\02
A number of transmission system reinforcements to de-bottleneck and expand the system to 
ensure that additional generating capacity can be absorbed in the system 
\01\02
Continuation of critical loss reduction and rehabilitation programs in major load centers 
\01\02
Expansion of the distribution system to meet growing demand  
\01\02
Rural electrification schemes (both grid connected and off grid systems) 
 
Technical Assistance
 
 (US$2 to 5 million)
 
\01\02
Engineering services related to the implementation of the investment components 
Page  2
 
 
\01\02
Assistance with the implementation of the reform program (including setting the regulatory body) 
\01\02
Capacity building and training 
 
These proposed investments form part of PEC’s least cost investment program.  For some of the technical assistance 
need the possibility of funding from suitable grant resources will be explored.   
 
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Project preparation missions are scheduled to take place in December and January 2003/2004 to finalize the project 
components.  Safeguard staff is anticipated to participate in the January 2004mission to determine extend of 
environmental work required.  Given the nature of the proposed project, no involuntary resettlement is anticipated at 
this stage and  we do not anticipate that major environmental assessment would be required.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
 
PEC, the implementing agency is familiar with the Bank’s safeguard requirements, but institutional capacity needs 
to be re-assessed during project preparation
