                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The objective of this proposed project is to improve access to nutrient-rich food of plant and animal
                           origins by poor households in selected areas in Cote d'Ivoire. The diversification of production will
                           contribute to improved access to nutritious foods by poor households as well as to enhanced
                           household income, while diversification of diet and amelioration of hygiene practices will
                           improvehealth and nutrition outcomes.

                           Helen Keller International (HKI) considers Côte d'Ivoire as a fertile ground to implement the
                           Enhanced Homestead Food Production (EHFP) initiative for many reasons, including the fact that the
                           country has a variety of agro-climatic zones, with appropriate infrastructure and marketing
                           opportunities for agricultural production. This new approach provides a set of scaled up integrated
                           nutrition and food security interventions using a programming platform based on agriculture.
                           C. Project Description
                         The overall aim of this proposed grant is to support the implementation of an EHFP-centered
                         intervention that improves the nutritional status of the beneficiaries of the project through food
                         production and nutrition behavioral change. This grant proposal among others is informed by the
Public Disclosure Copy




                         HKI pilot project that was implemented in Cote d’Ivoire in 2012 that adapted and developed a
                         standardized conceptual approach used by the organization worldwide, namely the Enhanced
                         Homestead Food Production or EHFP. With its nutritional and health benefits, introducing
                         complementary foods such as vegetables and innovative products (e.g. the orange-fleshed sweet
                         potato is suitable to combat essential micronutrient deficiencies especially vitamin A deficiency and
                         to a lesser extent anemia) will also have an additional contribution in increasing the income of the
                         poor farmers. Further, the design is also informed by the nutrition sensitive agriculture operations
                         that the GFADR is implementing world-wide.

                         The project will include the promotion of the production, consumption and marketing of bio-fortified
                         crops, mainly Orange-Fleshed Sweet Potato (OFSP) to combat Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD). OFSP
                         is ranked among the bio-fortified crops due to its very high levels of essential nutrients. A very small
                         tuber (100-125 grams) of OFSP varieties provides the daily nutritional intake recommended for
                         children under 8 and 200-250 grams for adults’ needs). (OFSP is a tuber that is a high source of
                         vitamin A. .

                         The project will be composed of four components: (i) support to homestead gardens; (ii) capacity
                         improvement and nutrition education; (iii) improving access to infrastructure; and (iv) M&E and
                         project implementation.

                         Component 1 -- Support to production of nutrient rich high-value crops: (US$1.0 Million) The aim of
                         this component is to demonstrate and support small poor farmers to adapt an improved and
                         diversified production system centered at nutrition-rich produce. The project will support the
                         development of such demonstration farms and homestead gardens. The component will adapt the
                         EHFP approach and will support the production of crops that includes: OFSP, fruits, vegetables

                         (eggplant, okra, peppers, beans), leafy vegetables and marketable produce (e.g. tomato, onion, carrot,
                         cabbage, squash, etc.). Animal food will be adapted to local context. This component will leverage
                         the resources of the IDA financed ASAP operation in ensuring agricultural input and micro-irrigation
                         equipment are supplied to sufficiently respond to beneficiary farmers demand and the assessed
                         requirements. This component will be composed to two sub-components:

                         1.1 Establishing homestead Gardens and demonstration farms

                         Depending on the spatial concentration of villages (distance between huts), homestead gardens near
                         huts or on the outskirts of villages will be established. Should the group have a community farm, this
                         will be arranged as portions for both the demonstration farm and for each of the women in the group.

                         Depending on the spatial concentration of villages (distance between huts), the establishment of
                         homestead gardens near huts or on the outskirts of villages will be implemented. Should the group
                         have a community farm, this will be arranged as portions for both the demonstration farm and for
                         women farmers group. Such women group already exist in the project area.

                         These homestead gardens and demonstration farms will produce orange-fleshed sweet potato, and
                         also serve as space for raising poultry and small livestock year-round. Food production will cover
                         the whole year with crop choices suited to seasonality (rainy season from May/June to October and
                         dry season from November to April). In addition, thanks to the irrigation system that will be
                         implemented in the demonstration farms (drip irrigation using groundwater wells) and household
                         gardens, the productions of off-season crops (such as leafy vegetables) including in the dry season

                         will be supported.

                         Village demonstration farms will be supplied with good quality seeds and planting materials,
                         agricultural inputs, agricultural tools and equipment. Local crops will be produced in fields
                         cultivated by women’s groups (40 women/group). Products from demonstration sites will be shared
                         among women. Each demonstration farm will be given hens and roosters. Depending on the context,
                         groups can also include raising goats. The choice of stock breeding will depend on the nutritional
                         benefits (e.g.: eggs, goats milk, etc.) and marketing opportunities.

                         The EHFP will include various crops: OFSP, fruits, vegetables (eggplant, okra, peppers, beans), leafy
                         vegetables and marketable garden products (e.g. tomato, onion, carrot, cabbage, squash, etc.).
                         Animal feed will also be supported.

                         Using HKI established relationship with suppliers of local seed and tools special efforts will be made
                         to ensure that a diversity of crops is grown, including those for sale (such as onion, tomato, etc.) and
                         those intended for home consumption (carrot, OFSP rich in vitamin A, papaya, leafy vegetables,
                         etc.).

                         Finally, it is expected that demonstration farms and homestead gardens produce enough to generate
                         marketable surpluses for local markets, and consequently improving food security in the locality
                         while increasing household income of project beneficiaries.

                         1.2 Technical and hands-on support:
                         Homestead and demonstration farms will be closely supported by specialized groups that operate in
                         the project area. The project will provide technical and farm inputs (seeds/cuttings, chicks, tools,
                         fertilizers, foods, etc.) support to implementation partners (local active NGOs or other specialized
Public Disclosure Copy




                         groups) in the targeted districts to enable them to promote the integration of EHFPs in their activities.
                         The staff of these organizations will train farmers, mostly women, on creating demonstration plots
                         that promote the creation of homestead gardens.

                         All Villages Agriculture Leaders (Agriculteurs Leaders des Villages -- ALVs ) will receive a variety
                         of healthy orange-fleshed sweet potato seeds and cuttings. The ALVs will provide assistance to a
                         group of 40 women/mothers in their respective village. Assistance will include monthly training
                         sessions covering gardening techniques and improved used of agricultural inputs. As for the use of
                         the production from their demonstration farms, ALVs are required to provide their groups with part
                         of their surpluses of OFSP seeds and cuttings and livestock. The modality of this support will be
                         discussed with community leaders during project appraisal.

                         Expected outputs from this component include: number of hectares brought under the production of
                         high nutrient content food (both directly and as a result of demonstration effect), number of home
                         gardens established; area brought under micro-irrigation, number of women involved in production
                         of high nutrient-dense crops and at least 75% of the locally produced food consumed in the
                         community thereby improving the nutrition status of beneficiary households.

                         Component 2- capacity improvement and nutrition education (US$0.5 million): The aim of this
                         component is to effect change in nutrition behavior and to improve the technical capacity of
                         extension agents to enable them provide current and relevant advice to farmers in diversification of
                         their agricultural output. The component will support hands-on training to extension agents and
                         nutrition education to beneficiaries to enhance their appreciation of product diversification and

                         improved diet.

                         2.1. Nutrition Education
                         The EHFP program will serve as a platform where nutrition behavior change will be firmly grounded
                         such that micronutrient-rich foods produced are optimally consumed by young children and their
                         mothers. The Essential Nutrition Actions (ENAs) framework has been extensively tested by the
                         USAID and its partners. It has shown positive effects on nutrition behaviors and maternal and child
                         health. In addition to ALVs, the program will identify and train key Community "levers", such as
                         Community Health Workers (CHWs), health and development workers who will disseminate key
                         messages on the seven Essential Nutrition Actions (ENAs) modules. ALVs, community "levers" and
                         CHWs (a total of four people per village) will be extensively trained on the use of advanced systems
                         for behavior change communication (BCC), techniques putting the emphasis on interpersonal
                         counseling and negotiation. Such training will also include food processing techniques.

                         ALVs will hold monthly meetings with the 40 farming mothers affiliated to their demonstration farm
                         to cover the ENAs topics and encourage the whole village community to attend nutrition education
                         and discussion sessions. These mothers, in turn, will be encouraged to reach out to other mothers in
                         their communities to promote the key messages and share knowledge. Existing recent formative
                         research has been used by HKI to develop a culturally appropriate strategy suitable for behavior
                         change in the country. The BCC national policy was approved by the Ministry of Health and Fight
                         against AIDS in 2011. That strategy has identified key messages and approaches needed to achieve
                         the adoption of health and optimal nutrition behaviors.

                         The communication strategy will also reach men whose understanding and support is vital to the
                         desired behavior change. The nutrition education will include cooking demonstrations to promote the
                         consumption of micronutrient-rich foods. Due to the need for livestock rearing and improvement of
Public Disclosure Copy




                         bioavailability of micronutrients in foods of animal origin, messages will concern the increase in
                         consumption of said foods by the target population. Farmers will be encouraged to sell only surplus
                         production once the nutritional needs of the household members have been met.
                         Nutritional education will also support food processing to make culinary dishes with local products
                         (porridge and “Kabato” made with maize flour, soya and OFSP, etc.). Partnership with universities
                         that have laboratory facilities will be pursued to support and contribute to making culinary dishes
                         adapted to local contexts (most importantly with OFSP).
                         2.2 Capacity improvement
                         Under this sub-component, the project will provide capacity improvement support to extension
                         agents to enable them provide current and relevant advice to farmers in the production of selected
                         crops, in use of agricultural inputs, in post-harvest handling and marketing. Further, local agents will
                         be trained in effective management of water for agriculture, operation and maintenance of the micro-
                         irrigation systems and gender sensitivity. Further, extension agents capacity in cultivation techniques
                         (soil preparation, nurseries/seeding, fertilization, crops maintenance or management) as it applies to
                         crops supported under this grant will be supported. The activities under this sub-component will
                         allow not only improving the quality of advice farmers receive but also agricultural extension service
                         coverage that is also tailored to women needs.

                         As part of its partnership with the IDA supported ASAP operation, this JSDF grant will partner with
                         the National Rural Support Agency (ANADER) which is responsible for contributing to the
                         improvement of the living conditions in rural areas, among others, by designing and implementing
                         appropriate agricultural extension tools and programs to ensure outcome sustainability and its
                         dissemination to new non-project areas. The Grant will create and strengthen the extension system's
Public Disclosure Copy




                         capacity in implementing the EHFP approach. The partnership with other agricultural extension
                         services will be based on their capacity and comparative advantages both at technical and operational
                         level, in order to ensure effective communities’ capacity building in demonstration farm
                         management, and Behavior Change Communication (BCC).

                         Outputs under this component will include : nutritional guidelines produced (if possible in local
                         language) communication materials produce, awareness building and sensitization events conducted,
                         and technical manuals prepared for use by extension agents covering crops supported under this
                         grant.

                         Component three: Improving access to infrastructure: (US$0.74 million) The aim of this component
                         is to support a year-round production and reduce post-harvest loss and thus improve the handling of
                         improved nutrient rich products. The component is composed of two sub-components : This
                         component will also leverage the resources and infrastructure supported under the IDA supported
                         ASAP project in improving access to infrastructure.

                         3.1 improve access to water at farm level:
                         Under this sub-component, targeted communities will receive support for water resource
                         management and assistance in the use of water for garden planting and micro level farming. The
                         program will focus in villages and settlements with reasonable access to water or in those areas
                         where the IDA supported ASAP project has provided the potential access. In drier areas, the grant
                         will focus in areas served with ground water and will introduce drip irrigation that will maximize the
                         efficient utilization of the scarce water resources in such regions. The technology increases yield and
                         reduces the needs for irrigation by three-quarters, thus freeing women from the arduous task of
                         fetching water for garden. Moreover, as water is channeled straight to the plants' roots, there is less
                         loss due to evaporation and less weeds produced, so that the workload decreases. This technique will

                         be provided to all ALVs who will show its usefulness to the other women targeted in the village.

                         3.2 : support to post-harvest handling :
                         The project will also support improving access to warehouses in areas wherein c ommunities showed
                         interest and expressed demand for reducing post-harvest loss. While the modalities for such support
                         will be determined during appraisal, the project will have a small grant-window to help access to
                         storage facilities and the project will seek the partnership with the private sector in the establishment
                         and maintenance of the system.

                         Under this sub-component, farmers will be trained in harvesting, packaging and storage and by
                         partnering with the IDA financed ASAP operation, small equipment will be provided to support the
                         handling, processing and packaging of marketable products.

                         Outputs under this component will include number of hectares brought under micro-irrigation, % of
                         beneficiary farmers that report improved access to water, at least 75% of beneficiary farmers
                         reporting production of two-times a year; number of farmers who are trained in post-harvest
                         handling; % of production processed and packaged at farm level and % of farmers reporting in
                         improving their post-harvest handling knowledge

                         Component four: M&E and Project management and coordination –(US$0.4 million)
                         The aim of this component is to help the efficient management and coordination, monitoring and
                         evaluation of implementation and dissemination of the project outcome for replicability into other
                         areas.

                         3.1 Project management and coordination:

                         The project will be implemented by HKI. This international NGO will be responsible for the overall
                         coordination, procurement, financial management, M&E, preparing and providing periodic reports,
                         hiring relevant consultants for provision of services identified under the project, etc. HKI will hire
                         supervisors who will coordinate project implementation in the selected project areas. The HKI
                         country team at central level, supported by decentralized structures at regional level, will provide
                         technical support and monitoring and evaluation throughout the project duration. ANADER and
                         other local NGOs will be partners in the implementation of the project, especially in activities
                         executed at local level.

                         This JSDF financed project will fit into the existing institutional set up of the IDA financed
                         Agriculture Sector Support Project. The overall coordination will be done by the Steering Committee
                         (SC). The SC will review policy alignment, strategic directions, annual plans and the overall
                         monitoring set up for this JSDF financed project execution. HKI will be included in the Steering
                         Committee to review the particular aspects of alignment with food security and nutrition related to
                         food production.

                         At Regional Divisions (DR) in administrative regions, Departmental Divisions (DD) in the regional
                         administrative centers, as well as specialized structures (case of the MSFFE) will be involved in the
                         decentralized structure of project implementation. By design, the project operational monitoring
                         framework has a decentralized coordination architecture, with strong links between the central and
                         the regional branches called Project “Regional Monitoring Groups” (GRS). These groups provide
                         strategic directions for project implementation on the ground. GRS are chaired by regional prefects,
                         technical coordination being carried out by the Regional Divisions of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Public Disclosure Copy




                         with support from HKI supervisors based in each of the areas of intervention. Apart from the
                         periodic technical meetings, the GRS will hold two regular meetings each year, chaired by prefects.
                         It is believed that the decentralization policy implementation and the efficient inclusion of local
                         communities in the execution of the project, makes local authorities more accountable and thus help
                         in achieving a good pace of project implementation.

                         3.2. Monitoring and Evaluation

                         An M&E system to monitor nutritional outcome will be established under the Ministry of Agriculture
                         and the project will support the deployment of such system. Initially and up to project completion,
                         the system will have an interface with HKI. However, before project closes, MOA will fully absorb
                         the system into the Ministry. HKI will contract an M&E specialist who will be responsible to
                         coordinate M&E tasks, consolidate reports and conduct the day-to-day M&E tasks. M&E expert
                         who will also be responsible for providing training and facilitating participatory monitoring by
                         beneficiaries and will work closely with Ministry of Agriculture ASAP coordination unit under
                         Ministry of Agriculture. During appraisal the modality of reporting, adaption of participatory
                         monitoring module, frequency of reporting by participating institutions and the framework of the
                         system to be deployed within Ministry of Agriculture will be defined. Specific to this grant, a
                         baseline, mid-term and final evaluation will be conducted by independent consultant. This grant will
                         build on the existing ASAP IDA-supported project’s M&E framework. The M&E system will be the
                         backbone of monitoring project implementation advance, providing periodic reports, supporting
                         World Bank supervision project status update. During the first-six month of project implementation,
                         a baseline assessment will be conducted to allow the measurement of project outcome by the end of

                         B.      Implementing Agency Information
                         HKI is an international NGO with rich experience in the area of nutrition improvement support.
                         Since 1988, HKI’s EHFP program has helped communities in Asia and Africa develop local food
                         production systems, technically improved by the creation of homestead gardens with micronutrient-
                         rich year-round productions, supplemented with small livestock (poultry, etc.). HKI-Côte d'Ivoire has
                         worked with a limited number of villages in the north of the country. Encouraging results were
                         reported from this experience.

                         HKI is also a partner in a program to promote fortification and industrially processed dietary
                         supplements in Abidjan and in the major development centers. Through this program, HKI has
                         undertaken considerable formative research on the feeding practices for infants and young children
                         and developed the promotion of ENAs modules. This will provide a solid foundation for the ENAs
                         promotion component in the EHFP project, in terms of behavior change. HKI has also developed
                         proposals to incorporate specific approaches that will improve women’s position in their
                         communities through economic activities such as the production and marketing of orange-fleshed
                         sweet potato. In parallel, the EHFP project will improve the coverage of the needs for agricultural
                         extension through services tailored to women. Thus, technically, HKI is capable of coordinating,
                         implementing and delivering the required result under this project.

                         Financial and procurement assessment will be conducted during project appraisal.
                         From technical perspective, this proposed JSDF project will partner and establish collaboration with
                         the International Potato Centre (Centro Internacional de la Papa -- CIP) and HarvestPlus (a
                         collaboration of several centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research --
                         CGIAR), which aims at reproducing staple crops for improved nutrition through biofortification.
