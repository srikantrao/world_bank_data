2. Project Objectives:

The project development objective is to increase solar electricity generation capacity and
diversify electricity generation resources in Zambia.

3. Project Description:

The project consists of the development, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of a
new 55 MWp solar PV plant located in the Lusaka South Multi-Facility Economic Zone in West
Lunga, Zambia (the “West Lunga project? or the “Neoen/First solar project?). The electricity
generated from the project will be sold to the Zambian utility company ZESCO through a 25 year
power purchase agreement (PPA).

The project is sponsored by Neoen SAS of France (“Neoen?), First Solar of USA (“First Solar?)
and IDC of Zambia. Neoen is a leading French developer specializing in the development,
financing, construction, and operation of renewable energy projects. Since its inception in 2008,
Neoen has financed 864 MW of renewable energy power projects (solar, wind, biomass) across
Africa, Europe, and Latin America. Solar represents the largest proportion of Neoen’s existing
portfolio with 431 MW of projects in operation and 102 MW under construction. First Solar is a
leading PV manufacturer in the United States of America (USA) and a provider of supporting
services (finance, construction, operation, maintenance, and end-of-life panel recycling) to utility-
scale PV power plants. First Solar has developed, financed, engineered, constructed and currently
operates many of the world’s largest grid-connected PV power plants. First Solar is publicly
listed and traded on NASDAQ.

Neoen/First Solar signed their Shareholder Agreement with IDC on November 4, 2016,
establishing the project company called Bangweulu Power Company Ltd., as a special purpose
vehicle incorporated in Zambia. The company is co-owned by Neoen, First Solar and IDC with
respectively 67 percent, 13 percent and 20 percent shareholding. The project expects to reach
financial close in March 2017. This project is presented for Bank’s approval through this PA.

The power plant covering a maximum footprint area of about 52 hectares will require about
460,000 thin film modules from First Solar and 12 transformers. The proposed PV system will be
connected to the grid and the electrical energy will be evacuated through a substation, via a 33kV
underground cable.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the assessment of
environmental and social risks and impacts:

The project site is situated within the Lusaka South Multi Facility Economic Zone (LS MFEZ)
about 15 km to the South and East of the Lusaka Central Business District. The site is bordered
by the Lusaka National Park to the South and some agricultural holdings to the East.
