                           C. Project Description
                           The project will pilot an innovative bottom-up approach to enable the vulnerable communities with
                           particular focus on women in two post-earthquake districts to be re-integrated in the social fabric of
                           society through the provision of post-traumatic training and apackage of a multidisciplinary skills.
                           Global evidence shows that supporting psycho-social well-being can enhance to help people cope in
                           context of post natural disasters has great impact for enhancing access economic and social
                           opportunities. Particularly, the project will focus on women recognizing that their social networks,
                           livelihood activities, and their usual day-to-day practice had changed in the last few months (post-
                           earthquake) without having the necessary technical, financial, and emotional skills and support to
                           cope with the changes. This innovative pilot will use a multi-disciplinary approach to trauma
                           sensitive training by integrating socio-emotional skills with soft skills (and other necessary skills that
                           the needs assessment will highlight-such as employability, mental health, etc...) to capture the links
                           between social vulnerabilities and social responses in post-disaster areas.
