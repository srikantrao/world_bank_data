                           B. Project Objectives
                           The project development objectives is to improve the capacity, efficiency and stability of Cameroon's
                           national electricity transmission network.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project development objectives is to improve the capacity, efficiency and stability of Cameroon's
                           national electricity transmission network. The proposed project will finance priority investments to
                         upgrade and extend the national transmission networks and strengthen the reliability of power supply
                         in the interconnected systems. It will also support the sustainable institutional setup to manage and
                         operate the existing and new transmission asset. Lastly, by supporting the development of a

                         hydropower project on the Sanaga River, it will support the further development of the sector and
                         ensure that the additional transmission capacity will in the future be utilized for cheap and clean
                         power.

                         The proposed project's main components, to be discussed with the government, are the following: (1)
                         establishment and operationalization of the national Transmission System Operator (TSO); (2)
                         strengthening of the national transmission grid; (3) technical support for competitive bidding for a
                         selected cost-efficient large-scale hydropower site; and (4) project management support and capacity
                         building.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Under component 2, the proposed project will finance a subset of the national electricity transmission
                         investment program (2016-2021), which has four main objectives: (i) Strengthening of Douala's
                         Transmission System; (ii) Strengthening of YaoundÃ©'s Transmission System; (iii) Strengthening
                         the three National Transmission Networks (RIS, RIE and RIN) and Interconnections; and (iv) a
                         "Smart Grid" Investment Package.

                         The project also aims, under component 3, at financing studies for potential hydropower dam project.

                         The list of investments to be financed by the proposed Project is still indicative and the exact location
                         of the transmission lines and substations will not be known at the time of appraisal. The specific
                         investment locations are not yet known. However, transmission lines may affect environmental
                         sensitive areas such as wetlands, forests, national parks, and in addition affect an area broader than
                         the sites subject to physical works in terms of land acquisition and its likely impacts that include
                         displacement and loss of livelihoods.

                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The two main institutions with responsibility for the environment and social safeguards policy are the
                         Ministry in charge of Environment and the Ministry in charge of Land Registration of the Republic
                         of Cameroon. The environmental law of 1996 and its implementation decrees require that
                         environmental assessments be conducted for all large energy and other infrastructure projects which
                         have to be approved by the Ministry in charge of Environment through a Certificate of Conformity.
                         The capacity of all governmental agencies of implementing environmental and social regulation in a
                         sustainable way and supervising the enforcement of environmental management plans can be
                         strengthened.

                         There is a risk of delays due to inadequate planning and implementation of compensation and
                         resettlement measures under Cameroonian law. In order to minimize the risk of delays, the team has
                         agreed with the GoC to adopt a number of measures to ensure the forward-looking and proactive
                         management of resettlement and compensation issues. The proactive measures include the
                         streamlining and earliest possible initiation of processes related to the request for the DUP,
                         establishment of the evaluation committees (CCE) which will identify the project affected persons
                         and a legal covenant to secure sufficient financial resources for compensation payments (condition of
                         effectiveness). While much of this process is governed by Cameroonian law, the Bank will support
                         the GoC to prepare a CPR and methodological note for the CCE that will clearly outline the process
                           and standards to be used to determine eligibility and compensation amounts. It is expected that this
                           unified approach will reduce the amount of time required to complete the process.
