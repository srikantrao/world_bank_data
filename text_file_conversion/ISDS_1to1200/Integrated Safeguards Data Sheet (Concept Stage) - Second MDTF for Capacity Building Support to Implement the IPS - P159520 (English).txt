                           The PDO does not change with this additional financing of the IPS 2 Trust Fund. The PDO is to
                           "Strengthen the implementation of the Integrated Planning System, by creating the conditions for
                           introducing a performance orientation in the policy planning and budgetary processes and by
                           improving institutional capacity to monitor results at the strategy and program levels".
                           C. Project Description
                           The additional financing will be used to close the financing the gap that arises as a result of the
                           higher cost of AFMIS/IPSIS and External Assistance Management Information System relative to
                           earlier estimates.
                           The ongoing project consist of three substantive components and a fourth component for project
                           management:
                           Component One – Strengthening Public Financial Management. The two most important outcome
                           indicators for this component measure improvement in the quality of Macroeconomic and Fiscal
                           Forecasts and improvements in MTBP monitoring and evaluation of the capacity of Line Ministries.
                           These outcomes have not yet been achieved. Despite the support in this area, the positive results that
                           were achieved until 2013, proved to be not sustainable due to changes in the structure of the Ministry

                           of Finance. The IPS Trust Fund along with other TA provided by the Bank, including the Functional
                           Review of the Ministry of Finance, and most importantly the EU budget support, will continue to
                           support this component.
                           Component Two – Improving Policy Coordination and Aid Management. The proposed outcomes
                           for this component include approval of the National Strategy for Development and Integration,
                           support for the establishment of Delivery Unit, and streamlining of the structure of sector strategies
                           an improvements in strategy prioritization and costing.
                           Component Three – IPS Management Information Systems. This component will support the
                           integration of the PFM and policy processes. This will be facilitated through the integrated AFMIS
                           that will link the MTBP to Treasury, thereby enabling the regular tracking of results at the program
                           level (outputs) and their linkage to budgetary inputs. In parallel, the IPSIS system, which will be
                           linked to the AFMIS, will facilitate the monitoring of program-level outputs as well as policy
                           implementation and strategy-level intermediate outcomes.
                           The additional financing will only support the scale up of the Albanian Financial Management
                           Information System and Integrated Planning System Information System.
