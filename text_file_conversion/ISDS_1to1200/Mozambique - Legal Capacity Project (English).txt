B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The objective of the proposed project is to assist Mozambique’s legal and judicial sector in the 
delivery of more effective and efficient services.  The project should produce the following 
direct results: (a) improved performance of selected legal officials through targeted training; (b) 
improved satisfaction of legal services by key stakeholders; and (c) expanded opportunities for 
access to legal services for disadvantaged groups. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project will be financed through an investment or technical assistance loan, or, 
even more likely, a combination of both types of loans with the Ministry of Justice as lead 
implementing agency.  The actual selection of project components will depend on the specific 
needs, available government’s funds, and donor involvement.  The total estimated cost of the 
reform program will be assessed at appraisal, but includes significant support from other donors 
active in Mozambique.

The proposed Project will build on the results achieved by the previous credit to the sector, 
which closed on June 30, 2000, and the recently concluded Legal and Judicial Sector 
Assessment.  As referred to above, the Government’s vision strategy—sponsored by DANIDA—
will provide additional input. 
 
The following project components are under consideration:  
(a) Improving court performance; 
(b) Piloting access to justice initiatives; and (c) Knowledge development and dissemination
.
(a) The court performance 
component will include
 
the design and implementation of analytical 
methods and data collection of court cases, developing and implementing a program to train and 
retain a cadre of qualified court staff (e.g., judges, administrators) to be posted in key positions in 
the Judiciary, and the modernization of systems for court records and financial and 
administrative management so to ensure that the sector’s budget cycle is processed on a more 
realistic, integrated and rational basis.   
 
(b) The access to justice 
component will pilot, through subprojects, innovative ways to expand 
the dispute resolution services in the country in order to expedite their disposition and unburden 
the formal judicial system.  Part of this component will assist in disseminating relevant 
sector/legal information to local communities and non-governmental organizations to ensure 
broader coverage.
 
(c) The Knowledge development and dissemination
 component will reinforce the capacity of the 
Center for Legal and Judicial Training in Matola, outside Maputo, as a premier training 
institution for legal training in the country.  Currently the Center 
only
has basic infrastructure to 
provide training for up to 30 newly recruited sector officials, resources are urgently needed to 
improve the skills of provincial and district judges and court staff outside Maputo through 
continuing education opportunities (
‘reciclagem’
).  Efforts will be made to partner with 
experienced international and regional organization working in this area.
 
Specific activities 
under this component include:   
 
(i)  design and implementation of training (including through possibly distance learning 
activities) in selected areas, including 
inter alia 
commercial and contract law, 
investigation and prosecution of fraud and corruption activities, and alternative dispute 
resolution methods; (ii) design and implementation the training programs required in 
component (a) above; (iii) development of studies and educational materials in selected 
areas including judicial organization, commercial and property registries, and 
rural/community court systems, and legal aid for the poor; and  (vi) project management 
activities.    
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
While the project will work with capacity building for central judicial functions in Maputo, it 
will also work to improve the administration of justice at the local level through the district 
courts.  No infrastructure, remodeling, or rehabilitation of courts is currently contemplated under 
this project.  Therefore, no impact on the local environment(s) is anticipated.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The project will be managed within the Ministry of Justice.  While, generally speaking, project 
management has been lacking in Mozambique, project management capacity has been created by 
other donors in this sector and could also be used for the purposes of strengthening the 
implementation framework for this project.
