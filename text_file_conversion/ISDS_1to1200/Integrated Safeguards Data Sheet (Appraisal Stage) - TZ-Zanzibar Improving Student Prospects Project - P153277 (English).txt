                           subjects
                            3. Project Description
                           For PDO achievement, a focused and evidence-based solutions approach is - (a) reinforced and (b)
                           incentivized - at each level of service delivery: teacher, school, and system. The solutions approaches

                                                                        Page 1 of 6
                         central to project design is to help tailor instruction to student’s level of knowledge . Project
                         effectiveness is further enhanced by focusing delivery on Math, Science, and English (MSE) subjects
                         in Standard 5 – Form 2.

                         The project has four components: (i) Component 1: Effective MSE Instruction; (ii) Component 2:
                         Improved School Autonomy and Learning Environment; (iii) Component 3: Hubs for Enhanced
                         MSE Learning; (iv) Component 4: Systems Transformation and Project Management

                         Component 1: Effective MSE Instruction: The main objective of this component is to improve the
                         quality of instruction and train teachers to provide focused student support for early resolution of
                         learning gaps. This will be done through a cohesive set of interventions that together address
                         constraints in three key domains—availability of trained teachers, teacher skills, and teacher
                         incentives and accountability structures. Accordingly, the component includes three types of
                         activities: (a) retraining of selected in-service teachers to increase the supply of Math and Science
                         teachers in lower secondary grades; (b) training of all English, Math, and Science teachers in targeted
                         grades in enhanced student support; and (c) teacher management reforms to strengthen teacher
                         accountability and motivation structures.

                         Component 2: Improved School Autonomy and Learning Environment. The main objective of this
                         component is to equip schools with resources and incentives to improve the quality of instruction and
                         student support. To this end, school improvement grants (SIGs) are expected to: remove charges to
                         parents in secondary schools (in support of the government’s policy of free basic education) and
                         provide additional resources and incentives at the school level to help improve education quality in
                         the face of expanding access.

                         Component 3: Hubs for Enhanced MSE Learning. The main objective of this component is to
                         support the impactful provision of learning facilities/resources for improved English, Science, and
                         Math achievement. It includes infrastructure provision and provision of teaching and learning
                         materials

                         Component 4: Systems Transformation and Project Management. This component will focus on four
                         areas: (a) examination reform; (b) mainstreaming enhanced student support at the school level; (c)
                         strengthening data systems and supporting project M&E; and (d) project implementation support.

                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              Only small scale construction is envisaged for class rooms and science laboratories a in the
                              confines of existing schools grounds. An ESMF has been developed to mitigate any impact that
                              may result from relevant works.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
