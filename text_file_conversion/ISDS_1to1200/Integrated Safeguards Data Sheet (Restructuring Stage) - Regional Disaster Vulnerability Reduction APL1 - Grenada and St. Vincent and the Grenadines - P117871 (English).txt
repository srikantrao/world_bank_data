                                                        pesticide use (e.g. termite treatment for building
                                                        foundations). As the use is not significant, no separate

                         Resources OP/BP 4.11           this safeguard is triggered as there is the small likelihood

                                                        particularly in the case of new construction. The EMF
                                                        provides for assessment and policy requirements, and

                                                        acquisition and/or resettlement will be mitigated by the

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                               In accordance with Bank environmental safeguards requirements, the project has been classified
                              as Category B, and the policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) is triggered.

                             Environmental Safeguards. The Government prepared an extensive revision to the program-level
Public Disclosure Copy




                             EMF in early 2014 for the first AF. The EMF describes the screening procedures to identify sub-
                             projects in environmentally complex settings or with potentially significant impacts (if
                             unmitigated) which must therefore have individual Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs)
                             prepared as required during implementation along with subproject-specific mitigation measures.
                             For relatively uncomplicated projects, the EMF includes generic mitigation measures through the
                             development of a generic EMP, referenced in the Operations Manual and to be included in future
                             environmental compliance contracting clauses. The EMF specifically responds to the types of
                             projects/sub-projects under Components 1 and 4 and also include standard procedures for
                             mitigating environmental impacts of construction, monitoring and reporting. The EMF assesses
                             sub-projects of similar typologies to the new proposed AF, therefore, no substantial revision to the
                             EMF is required, but only minor updates to the list of sub-projects and a clarification that the Pest
                             Management Policy was triggered (see discussion below) for incidental use such as termite
                             treatment of building foundations.

                             Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04. The EMF accounts for natural habitats when screening both known
                             works and any future activities currently undefined. Most works in the parent project portfolio will
                             not affect natural habitats, and only a few have been identified with the potential to do so (interior
                             roadworks at Fenton Road, Green Hill, and various coastal works). During AF assessment,
                             potentially sensitive areas were identified in two similar interior roads (Congo Valley and
                             Longline Bridge) and one coastal work (Chateubelair jetty), both very similar to the parent project


                                                                        Page 4 of 9
                          works. The EMF contains guidance and procedures for screening future projects and triggering
                          additional studies at these sites. During project implementation, candidate work sites will be
                          identified and reviewed for potential application of this policy. In the case of future undefined
Public Disclosure Copy




                          works, this policy along with all other Bank safeguards has been included in the screening
                          procedures provided under the project EMF.

                          Forests OP/BP 4.36. Forest resource harvesting is not included in any project interventions, nor are
                          there are any proposals to develop integrated watershed management plans or other activities with
                          possible implications for forest management. Additional research and subsequent definition of
                          sub-projects during project preparation have shown that this safeguard will not be triggered.
                          Planned slope stabilization works will not impact the management, protection and/or utilization of
                          forests nor are any projects involving harvesting or converting forest resources considered under
                          the project.

                          Pest Management OP 4.09. This safeguard has been triggered, as subproject activities may require
                          the purchase or use of small amounts of pesticide through licensed registered professional
                          contractors (e.g. termite treatment for building foundations). Use or purchase of significant
                          amounts of pesticides is excluded in the EMF by screening as well as through standard contract
                          clauses, therefore no separate Pest Management Plan is required; instead, the EMF includes
                          appropriate procedures in the generic standardized measures for incorporation into contract
                          clauses.

                          Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11. This safeguard is triggered as a precaution as project
                          activities may potentially include historical building retrofits, restoration of culturally significant
                          structures, and chance finds of historically or culturally significant resources during construction
                          of works. The EMF includes screening for historical structures as well as a "chance-find"
                          procedure, particularly during activities such as major excavations, road realignments or similar
                          works where such assets could be affected.

                           Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12. This safeguard is triggered given the likelihood that several
                           of the sub-project sites under Parent Project and AF could lead to the necessity to acquire land,
                           depending on final designs. Any potentially negative impacts with respect to land acquisition and/
                           or resettlement would be minor in nature and will be mitigated by the presence of a Social
                           Development Team, within the PMU, tasked with community outreach and consultation to
                           affected persons, and the development and implementation of RAPs and associated compensatory
                           and mitigating measures in line with the RPF developed for the Parent Project. The original RPF
                           did not require substantive revision given that the activities planned under the AF are similar in
                           nature and extent to those under the Parent Project. However, the RPF was updated in March 2016
                           to reflect the additional investments under AF and disclosed in-country and through InfoShop on
                           March 3, 2016.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                            The Project neither stimulates negative indirect impacts nor induces future activities in the
                           project areas. Benefits and positive impacts will accrue from the improved resiliency of
                           infrastructure and the increased capacity of the Government in managing environmental aspects.

                          No potential long term or indirect social impacts are anticipated. The social benefits of the Parent
                          Project are expected to be positive and will remain so under the AF. Improved infrastructure


                                                                       Page 5 of 9
                           resilience in the transport and coastal management sectors will likely lead to reduced flooding
                           exposure and reduced disruptions in the lives of the relevant communities and will promote an
                           increased sense of safety and security.

                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                            Studies for coastal defenses and road works include alternative evaluations as part of the
                           engineering and design efforts, to avoid or minimize potential adverse impacts.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                            The Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Central Planning Division (CPD) will manage
                           the supervision of environmental compliance, while receiving technical support from the Ministry
                           of Transport and Works (MoTW). The PMU has staffed a full-time Field Supervision Engineer
                           with experience on similar projects (Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery) and so is familiar
                           with environmental requirements; a new staff member within the PMU is also being trained. In
                           addition to Bank requirements, the PMU will also be responsible for (a) ensuring the proper
                           application of national environmental laws, (b) ensuring environmental compliance in accordance
                           with procedures detailed in the project's Operations Manual and (c) reflecting such requirements in
                           associated works contracts. The PMU has also staffed a Senior Project Engineer with abundant
                           experience to help guide the execution of the project, ensure that environmental protection
                           measures are implemented by contractors, and otherwise provide support to the Project.

                           Technical staff of participating Ministries will assist with contract supervision.

                           A World Bank Environmental Specialist will further provide additional technical support by
                           periodic field supervision. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and terms of reference will
                           be forwarded to the Bank for review. EIAs produced will be forwarded to the Bank for review
                           prior to the development of specific works contracts. All works contracts requiring an EIA will be
                           subject to prior review and supervision missions will review project activities with respect to

                           environmental compliance.

                           On the Social Safeguards, the capacity of the PMU to manage involuntary resettlement and
                           broader social impacts has been enhanced during the implementation of previous investments
                           including the Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery Loan and the RDVRP/Parent Project. There
                           are 4 staff within the PMU responsible for the social aspects and they have the requisite skills and
                           experience to incorporate the AF activities into the Parent Project.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                             The majority of works contemplated involve the repair and retrofitting of existing infrastructure.
                           In these cases, impacts to stakeholders will relate to temporary inconveniences, and potential land
                           acquisition and/or resettlement associated with construction activities, and will be managed to
                           minimize impacts to the greatest extent possible. Advanced public notifications will inform
                           potentially affected persons, who, if necessary, will be compensated prior to works. Relevant line
                           ministries will assist MoTW and the PMU in these efforts.

                           When subproject-specific safeguards instruments, (Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs),
                           Social Impact Assessments (SIAs) or Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs)) are required, specific
                           stakeholders will be identified and public meetings will be conducted to enable the reflection of


                                                                       Page 6 of 9
                           stakeholder concerns in project design. These requirements will be incorporated into the terms of
                           reference for EIAs and SIAs. In the case of land acquisition, the Project affected peoples (PAPs)
                           will be consulted in the identification, development, and implementation of the mitigation
