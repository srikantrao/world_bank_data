    3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

COMPONENT A: Petroleum Sector - Reforms and Capacity Building


Sub-component A.1         Petroleum Communication. The proposed sub-component will provide support to develop a
National Communications Strategy (NCS) and implementation plan to empower a greater proportion of the Somali
public to effectively participate in the ongoing dialogue on using the petroleum deposits as a source of national wealth
and to build trust in government institutions.


Sub-component A.2       Institutional Reforms. The proposed sub-component will provide support to the mandate,
design and implementation of the Somalia Petroleum Authority (SPA) among others by 1) Defining its organizational
structure and associated job descriptions, 2) Development of business processes and operational procedure.



COMPONENT B: Project Management

The objective of Component B is to support the Federal Government of Somalia and its Federal Member States in
managing and coordinating the Project and building its procurement, financial management, safeguards management,
and monitoring and evaluation capacity through the provision of technical advisory services, training, acquisition of
goods, and operating costs.

    4. PROJECT LOCATION AND SALIENT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS RELEVANT TO THE SAFEGUARD ANALYSIS (IF
       KNOWN)
    The activities under the project will be related only to the onshore areas of Somalia as well as to those areas
    offshore the coast of Somalia that are not disputed. The proposed Project Area will therefore be defined to
    exclude any disputed areas, whether onshore or offshore. As a consequence, none of the envisaged activities
    are expected to have any impact on any areas that may be the subject of a dispute between Somalia and any
    of the neighboring countries.

KEY_POLICY_TABLE
II. KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT

 A.     SUMMARY OF KEY SAFEGUARD ISSUES


 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any
      potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
      The project will exclusively focus on capacity building activities, including policy dialogues, training and report
      preparation. As a consequence, none of the envisaged activities under the project are expected to have a footprint
      with adverse environmental or social impact that could be categorized as sensitive, diverse or precedent setting. The
      project will not provide support to land use planning or spatial planning.



 2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
            The World Bank                                                                                        Appraisal ISDS
            Somali Petroleum Technical Assistance Project (SOPTAP) (P164175)



       Future investments in the petroleum sector may have sector risks and impacts associated with it. However, these
       future investments are substantially downstream. The sector yet to address initial capacity building and regulatory
       issues necessary in order to begin to build a relevant environmental and social impact assessment and mitigation
       system.


     3. Describe any potential alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
       World Bank Safeguard Policy OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment is applicable to this TA. This TA will produce
       a Terms of Reference (TOR) for a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA), which will identify individual
       as well as cumulative environmental, social, health, and safety risks, impacts and gaps in Somalia's new mining and
       petroleum policies and propose measures to strengthen these aspects in the new policies. Implementation of the
       SESA will be the responsibility of the FGS outside of this project.


     4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower
       capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
       The new Petroleum Bill, presented to the Somalia Council of Ministers in September 2017, includes regulations
       covering environment, health and safety (EHS) to support the general upstream regulations. Current institutional
       capacity is nascent.


     5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanism for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with
       an emphasis on potentially affected people.
       This work will include development of a National Communication Strategy, with a Social Expert included as one team
       member in the NCS project team. The Social Expert, who will ensure that stakeholders for the NCS are identified,
       included in consultations on the draft Strategy, and their concerns documented and addressed in the revised Strategy.
       Key messages for national communication are to be developed in English and Somali. The sequencing of the National
       Communications Strategy as early in the development of the sector is expected to manage stakeholder expectations
       about economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits involved in petroleum exploration and possible
       extraction.
