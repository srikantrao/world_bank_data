Public Disclosure Copy




                         There are two project components, the first of which would co-finance selected programs that
                         structure the government?s integrated approach to promote social and economic development; and
                         the second of which would provide technical assistance to strengthen publicsector management. In
                         line with the government?s integrated strategy, the project activities are organized around three broad
                         axes and involve five sectors: (i) public sector management; (ii) sustainable rural development; (iii)
                         environmental and disaster risk management; (iv) health; and (v) education.

                         Component 1: Fostering equitable and environmentally sustainable economic and human
                         development (Estimated total cost: US$867 million; Bank: US$314.125 million). This component
                         would co-finance selected programs (the Eligible Expenditure Programs - EEPs) that structure the
                         Government?s integrated approach to promote social and economic development in ParanÃ¡, in an
                         equitable and environmentally sustainable manner.

                         Subcomponent 1.1: Sustainable Rural Development. The main challenge to be addressed by this
                         subcomponent is the need for small rural producers to engage more effectively in profitable
                         businesses, while also fostering a transition towards more sustainable agricultural practices
                         throughout the State of ParanÃ¡. The project would support the Government?s rural development
                         strategy by co-financing two EEPs.

                         EEP 1: Territorial Economic Development ? Proterritorios. This program aims at improving the
                         competitiveness of small family farmers in the 8 territories of the lagging Central Region. Specific
                         activities would include the following: (i) capacity building of approximately 20,000 small rural
                         producers in the Central Region, including vulnerable groups such as indigenous people and
                         quilombolas; (ii) strengthening public support services and infrastructure (research and innovation,
                         land regularization, and rural roads rehabilitation and maintenance), and (iii) support for sustainable

                         business initiatives of groups of small producers to foster their greater integration with remunerative
                         value-chains.

                         EEP 2: Integrated Natural Resource Management in Micro-catchments. This program aims at
                         fostering sustainable agriculture in those micro-catchment areas most susceptible to environmental
                         degradation. Specific activities would include the following: (i) modernization of SEAB and
                         EMATER?s tools and approaches for the management of the rural space, (ii) environmental
                         education, and (iii) the promotion of the adoption of sustainable agricultural and natural resource
                         management practices by small rural producers.

                         Subcomponent 1.2: Environmental and Disaster Risk Management. This subcomponent will focus on
                         tackling challenges in these two related areas: environmental and DRM management. Regarding
                         environmental management, the key goal is to strengthen overall environmental compliance and
                         monitoring by improving the Government?s capacity for delivering environmental registering,
                         licensing, and oversight services. In the case of DRM, the challenges are to improve the response
                         capacity and identification of risk in short/medium term while developing an integrated disaster risk
                         management policy in a medium/long term. The Government?s strategies to tackle these issues
                         translate into two Eligible Expenditure Programs to be supported by this Project.

                         EEP 3: Modernization of the Environmental Licensing System. This program aims to revise the state


                                                                      Page 2 of 11
                         procedures for environmental licensing and build capacity in the state environmental agencies in
                         order to strengthen environmental compliance and monitoring. The modernized Environmental
                         Licensing System would ensure that responsibilities for ensuring compliance with environmental

                         legislation are properly allocated and that the necessary data and systems are updated. It will be used
                         to monitor and control productive landscapes, vegetation cover in private landholdings, logging
                         concessions and water rights management.

                         EEP 4: Natural and Man-Made Disaster Risk Management. The State is looking for better
                         understanding and monitoring of risk, as well as for improved response capacity to disasters. In order
                         to do so, it has developed a program focused on improving the current data, risk models and
                         infrastructure technology currently used in the State; and also on building response capacity.

                         Subcomponent 1.3: Education. The government?s overall objective for the education sector is to
                         ensure that all children in ParanÃ¡ have access to good quality education. This subcomponent would
                         support three EEPs.

                         EEP 5: Learning Assessment System. This program seeks to establish a student evaluation system in
                         order to carry out standardized evaluations of learning outcomes of students in State schools.
                         Progressively the standardized evaluations would cover all the grades of the final cycle of
                         fundamental and secondary education in several subject matters.

                         EEP 6: Teacher Development Program. This program aims to develop and implement a new strategy
                         of in-service training developed at local level (i.e.: cluster of schools) with groups of 40 teachers
                         (oficinas).

                         EEP 7: Upgrading of school facilities (Renova Escola). Around 60 percent of State schools are in
                         need of renovation or repair, with problems varying from lack of water and electricity to physical
                         dilapidation. 1,500 schools were identified by the Civil Defense as being potentially dangerous. The
                         project would support the rehabilitation and repairs of existing State schools. For the latter, SEED

                         would include the construction of new classrooms and accommodations for science laboratories,
                         libraries and computer laboratories. In addition, the project would finance new school furniture and
                         some equipment.

                         Subcomponent 1.4: Health. In light of the main challenges faced by ParanÃ¡ in the health area, the
                         government designed a strategy to improve the quality of service provision and insure adequate
                         access to specialized treatment in the whole state, on a network basis. The strategy aims to introduce
                         changes the healthcare mode by integrating the state health system through the implementation of
                         Healthcare Networks in the 22 health administrative regions of the state. Two EEPs will be
                         supported by this Project.

                         EEP 8: Urgent Care and Emergency Network. This program aims to support the healthcare network
                         designed to establish adequate access to emergency care through the implementation of a pre-
                         hospital urgency and emergency system in the 22 State Health Administrative Regions. The program
                         would foster: i) in-service management training, improving management capacity for referral
                         hospitals/facilities with focus on scaling-up, care deliveries flows, logistics and managerial
                         processes; ii) technical care training, developing and implementing care guidelines grounded on
                         scientific evidence; iii) investment in pre-hospital facilities focusing safe patient access to referral
                         hospitals and including the expansion of trauma care, aero medical transport and specialized teams
                         for treating multiple trauma, myocardial infarction and stroke; and v) results-based contracts with

                                                                      Page 3 of 11
                         providers to ensure the implementation and maintenance of quality staff in agreement with the
                         emergency regulatory framework.

                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will support activities to improve services delivery in all municipalities of the ParanÃ¡
                         State.

                         ParanÃ¡ State, with a surface area of about 200.000 km2, is formed by different phytogeographical
                         regions resulting from geomorphological and climate peculiarities of each region. The floristic
                         composition is composed by the Atlantic Forest biome, which corresponds to different ecosystems,
                         such as ombrophilous dense atlantic forest (auraucaria forest), mixed ombrophilous forest,
                         semideciduous seasonal forest, steppe (fields), herbaceous vegetation, mangroves, ?vÃ¡rzea? and
                         rupestrian vegetation. There is also a remnant of the ?cerrado? with savanna vegetation.

                         The Atlantic Forest biome originally corresponded to 97% of the State?s territory. Currently this
                         threatened biome it has been reduced to 18% of its original area (well-preserved native areas
                         comprise less than 3-5% of ParanÃ¡). Of special interest is the critically endangered Araucaria
                         Forest, which once covered more than one third of the State?s territory, and the coastal Atlantic
                         Rainforest, Brazil?s most threatened forest ecosystem.
                         The climatic conditions in ParanÃ¡ range from tropical to sub-tropical and temperate zones, with
                         temperatures ranging from 30Â°F to 80Â°F. The sub-tropical and temperate zones in ParanÃ¡ get
                         frost in the winter season (June-September).

                         The state is well supplied by hydrological resources. A well-distributed river basin network, makes
                         ParanÃ¡ one of the country?s main hydroelectric supplier. Parana?s topography consists of a narrow

                         coastal plain separated from the interior of the state by an abrupt wall: the Serra do Mar mountain
                         range to the west of which are 3 successive plateaus. More than half of the state is above 2000 feet in
                         altitude.

                         Historically, land use in the State of ParanÃ¡ has been agricultural based activities. The traditional
                         crops have been corn, soy, sugar cane, wheat cultivars and pasture areas. The intensive use of land
                         for these crops contributed to soil and forest degradation. This unsustainable land use, especially
                         along riparian forests have affected not only ecosystems but also led to the loss of biodiversity,
                         increased carbon emissions and others ecological and socioeconomic impacts.

                         The soils are generally fertile, although prone to erosion. Expansion of the agricultural frontier over
                         the past decades has reduced the native vegetation. Poor management of fragile soils has led to their
                         degradation and threatens farm productivity, especially in the rugged Central Region where steep
                         slopes have been continuously cultivated.

                         Bank-supported projects (Land Management Project, 1989-1997, Rural Poverty Alleviation and

                         introduce environmentally sound agricultural practices and promote environmental awareness.
                         Nevertheless, the natural resource-base, especially in the Central Region (target area for the
                         Sustainable Rural Development subcomponent), remains fragile with the need for continued

                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                               There is no additional impact envisaged as a result of the restructured Project. Any environmental
                              impacts are expected to be localized and preventable through responsive mitigation measures. The
                              project does not entail any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible negative impacts.

                             An Environmental Management Framework (EMF) was prepared due to: (i) the multi-sector
                             nature of the Project which requires engagement on safeguards management with multiple actors
                             and counterparts with varying levels of capacity; and (ii) the range of activities which requires the
                             preparation and review of multiple safeguards instruments. This EMF is being implemented and
Public Disclosure Copy




                             properly monitored and evaluated by the Borrower.

                             The Project implementation procedures are adopting strict environmental "screens" to ensure that
                             subcomponent activities demonstrate low potential for negative impact. The EMF assessed the
                             most common types of intervention expected, in order to propose mitigation measures a priori.

                              Likewise, the Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) and the Resettlement Policy
                              Framework (RPF) are being applied to ensure that activities of the project are properly screened
                              and managed.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                               No significant residual adverse environmental impacts are expected as a result of future activities
                              in the project areas.

                             Moreover, the Environmental and Disaster Risk Management component will strengthen the State
                             environmental licensing and an integrated disaster risk management policy and early warning and
                             response system.

                             The implementation of a robust web-based environmental system should lead to improve
                             environmental performance, including better and more consistent legal compliance and

                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.

                           farm and off-farm infrastructure; and (iv) improvement of agriculture (and other) production
                           technologies (e.g., product diversification and/or value-added products).
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                            The State of ParanÃ¡ has advanced environmental laws, reflecting a political culture of strong
                           environmental protection. The State has prepared an Environmental Management Framework for
                           the Project which will provide overall guidance as to how to proceed during implementation. The
                           Borrower has prepared an EMF, an IPPF and an IRF. Site-specific screening is being conducted
                           and impact mitigation actions are being implemented, as needed, during subcomponents
                           implementation which complies with the overall project safeguard framework.

                           To ensure safeguards compliance, focal points (one at each Subcomponent) are in charge of
                           overseeing the implementation of the EMF procedures set out for the respective subcomponents.
                           Moreover, SEPL is supervising the compliance with the requirements detailed in the EMPs, IPPs
                           IPPF and RPF, providing additional training where necessary.

                             In accordance with Bank policy, several rounds of consultations were held with a wide range of
                           stakeholder. Their views and recommendations were taken into account in the design of the
                           subcomponents. No major issues were raised, and the proposed project received strong support
                           from the groups consulted. (colegiados territoriais, Grupo Gestor das Microbacias, civil society

                           Prior and informed consultations were carried out with indigenous peoples during 2009-2010, and
                           additional consultations in August 2011. The EMF has been disseminated in Brazil through the
                           website (http://www.sepl.pr.gov.br), and contains a more detailed description of possible positive
                           and negative environmental impacts of the project supported subcomponents.
