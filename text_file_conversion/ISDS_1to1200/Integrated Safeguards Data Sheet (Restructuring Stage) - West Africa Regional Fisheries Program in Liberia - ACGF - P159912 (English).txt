                           The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) of this project is to complete key construction
                           works at Mesurado Pier and Robertsport landing site. With WARFP SOP-A1 disbursements in
                           Liberia reaching 98 percent, the ACGF financing will allow the country to access funds not available
                           from elsewhere to accomplish the rehabilitation of the Mesurado industrial fishing complex, while


                                                                                  Page 1 of 4
                         also expanding economic opportunities for the country➢❨ s small scale coastal fisheries. The
                         completion and integration of the Mesurado-Robertsport fishery clusters would indeed provide a
                         central point of control for all the industrial and the majority of the coastal fisheries catch in Liberian

                         waters, to facilitate inspections and the implementation of both port state measures, and fish catch
                         and effort monitoring. Once completed, the ACGF financing will allow Liberia to scale up the
                         impacts of project activities to increase the contribution of fish resources to the local economies, by
                         substantially increasing the amount of fish that can be processed and exported from the country.

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                The additional financing being provided on the project is not expected to finance any large scale
                              civil works and the impacts will be minimal. However an EMP as an addendum to the ESMP from
                              the ACGF1 project to address any impacts from the 250m access road to Robertsport fish landing
                              site and the 30m paving within the fish landing site should be prepared. An EMP will also be
                              developed to guide the rehabilitation works proposed at Banjur and King Gray though expected
                              impacts from the rehabilitation works are of minimal risk.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                                The main social concerns raised in the ESIA are influx of construction workers seeking
                              employment opportunities to disrupt local social cohesion, particularly in the case of Robertsport.
                              Also, the presence of large number of workers may give rise to increased diseases such as the
                              spread of HIV/AIDS.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                                There are no project alternatives relevant to the project.

                              assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                                The borrower is in the processing of hiring a full time safeguards specialist to support the
                              implementation of proposed mitigation measures and general safeguards support to the project.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                              on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                                At the local level, stakeholders include fisher chiefs, female fish processors, community elders
                              and other community leaders. The consultation process encompasses various consultative
                              meetings with institutional stakeholders at the Ministry and Robertsport levels as well as the
                              stakeholders at the community levels described above. All safeguards instruments prepared such
                              as the ESIA have been consulted upon accordingly and published.
