A.2. Project Objectives 
The first objective is to assist in the rehabilitation of the areas affected by the recent 
adverse natural events. Satisfactory planning and completion of a rehabilitation scheme 
for affected settlements are key outcome indicators. 
 
The second objective of the project is to strengthen the country’s capacity to manage 
natural disaster risks and better respond to emergencies resulting from adverse natural 
events. The key outcomes for the capacity established within the DPC includes: (i) a 
validated legal framework;(ii) stronger management systems; (iii) improved technical 
capacity; and (iv) an operational, validated National Response Plan  
 
The third objective is to reduce the vulnerability of communities through risk 
identification and mapping, and risk mitigation activities at the local level. The outcome 
are functioning disaster committees in at least 70 communes and the successful 
implementation of risk prevention and reduction measures in vulnerable communities. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1 – Reconstruction and Risk Reduction in the Areas Recently Affected by 
Floods (US$2.5 million)
The DPC is currently preparing a recovery plan to support reconstruction of the areas 
affected by recent floods with the assistance of the UNDP. The proposed allocation will 
Page  2
be used in line with the plan developed and the activities implemented with the LICUS 
funds, and will assist small rehabilitation activities implemented by the affected 
communities through the financing of building materials, etc. 
 
Component 2 
–
Institutional Strengthening for the Directorate of Civil Protection (DPC) 
and the Permanent Secretariat for Risk and Disaster Management (SPGRD) (US$3.5 
million)
Institutional and Technical Support.  
The project will support the DPC and the SPGRD in 
the implementation of the National Plan for Risk and Disaster Management (PNGRD), 
including (i) the provision of institutional and technical support for  the creation of a 
training and documentation center; of risk management units within key ministries; and 
of three thematic committees under the SPGRD including public awareness, building 
norms, and land use planning; (ii) the revision and validation of the National Response 
Plan and the development of related emergency procedures and protocols; (iii) the 
creation, training and equipment of disaster assessment and disaster intervention teams, 
within DPC and key ministries; and (iv) the realization of simulation exercises at local 
and regional scale. 
 
Technical Studies. 
The establishment of the SPGRD thematic committees will lead to the 
implementation of three main technical studies.  First, the public awareness thematic 
committee will supervise the design and implementation of a public awareness program 
for the general public and decision makers to explain disaster management efforts to a 
larger audience.  Second, the building norms thematic committee will coordinate 
technical studies and workshops to support the establishment of building norms that take 
natural hazards into account.  The initiative will be implemented in close collaboration 
with the Ministry of Public Works and will aim at establishing norms from the 
construction of public buildings and donor funded projects.  Finally, the project will 
finance an environmental assessment study for natural disaster vulnerability, envisioned 
to connect the efforts of natural resource management to those of planning and risk 
reduction. This study will be implemented in coordination with the land use planning 
committee and in close collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources 
and Rural Development. 
 
Rehabilitation of the Emergency Operation Center of the DPC. 
To enable the efficient 
functioning of the DPC and SPGRD in times of crisis, the project will assist the 
retrofitting of the national Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and the purchase of the 
necessary equipment to make it operational.  The project will also support the retrofitting 
of regional EOC in each department as well as the installation of a national 
communication system to coordinate the operations between the national and 
departmental levels. 
 
Strengthening Management Systems within DPC. 
To better fulfill its functions, the DPC 
is to become a General Directorate within this calendar year. The project will strengthen 
the DPC with a new accounting system to monitor the funds it disburses and an updated 
inventory system to track its resources.  The project will also reinforce management, 
Page  3
administrative and technical capacity within the DPC and the SPGRD through training of 
its staff at the national and departmental levels.  Finally, the DPC’s planning capacity will 
be strengthened by supporting institutional development plans.  In conjunction to the 
UNDP effort to define the legal structure of the DPC, the project will also support the 
establishment of emergency funding procedures. 
 
Component 3 – Local Risk Management (US$5.5 million)
Almost 50 percent of the project funds will be used for development and mitigation 
activities at the local level in areas of high vulnerability to natural disasters. This 
component will help DPC create or reactivate local emergency committees and train them 
in risk and disaster management.  These committees, in coordination with community 
councils, will prepare local risk and vulnerability maps and identify risk reduction 
activities (early warning systems, retention walls, terracing, drainage works, pilot 
reforestation projects, shelter retrofitting, etc.) that the project will finance.  Some 70 
local committees are expected to be created or reactivated, 50 percent of which will be in 
urban or peri-urban areas.  The approach to implement most activities of this component 
will be Community Driven Development (CDD), already used on a pilot basis in two 
Bank-supported activities in Haiti. A national-level Government agency (PL 480) will 
coordinate the efforts on behalf of the DPC with the DPC directly involved in strategy 
formulation and the supervision. Several NGOs selected according to common criteria 
between IDA and the DPC will be responsible for the execution at the local level. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project will have impacts at national level through institutional and policy 
improvements.  In the regions of  Belle-Anse and Fonds Verrettes and the recently 
affected ones where Component I will be implemented reconstruction works will be 
undertaken reconstruction and mitigation works will be undertaken.  Component IV will 
finance disaster mitigation works in at least 70 communes throughout the country.  
 
Haiti lies in a hurricane belt and is subject to severe storms from June to October.  The 
effects of tropical storms and hurricanes include wind damage, flooding, landslides and 
coastal surges. Geological faults also make Haiti vulnerable to earthquakes.

Comments:
 
There are no major environmental or social issues identified.  The classification of the 
project is Category B due to potential adverse environmental impacts on human 
populations or environmentally important areas.  At the same time, the environmental 
impacts of reconstruction and mitigation works to community infrastructure are likely to 
be beneficial and to reduce environmental risk. 
 
The project is being processed under OP 8.50 (Emergency Recovery Assistance).  
Consistent with article 13 of OP4.01 the project be exempt from producing a EA report 
before appraisal.  A regional environmental assessment (REA) is planned and will cover 
a
majority of the activities implemented under the project.

–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
By its nature, the project will have a positive social impact since is expected to strengthen 
the national structure for emergency response and disaster management.  This goal will 
be accomplished by identifying hazard vulnerabilities and risks throughout the country, 
developing community level awareness and executing small disaster mitigation works to 
avoid natural disasters. 
 
The environmental issues will be specific to local areas since this emergency project's 
component 3 will focus on Local Risk Management helping DPC to create local 
emergency committees and train them in risk management together with some small 
disaster mitigation works. Construction of new infrastructure will be limited to projects 
that are necessary for rapid economic and social recovery.  Any major new infrastructure 
needs would be left for consideration beyond this project.  The small disaster mitigation 
works implemented under this project will have their environmental impact assessed 
according to usual procedures (screening and assessments) for community-based 
development projects as well as screening for cultural property. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
With the possible exception of rehabilitation works in the regions of  Belle-Anse, Fonds 
Verrettes and other regions affected by adverse natural events, indirect or long-term 
impacts will be minimal. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Local capacities for environmental assessment are very limited.  The project will 
therefore strengthen local authorities and to them develop and implement some 
environmental guidelines. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
