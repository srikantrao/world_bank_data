B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The overriding objective is to develop a program
of direct support to creditworthy municipalities for the 
purpose of fostering replicable models of sustainable, integrated urban environmental infrastructure and 
management with the aim of improving quality of life of all residents, in particular the poor. 
 
Indicators of success will include development of: 
·
Prototype interventions that can be used in scaling-up Bank municipal lending in Brazil through 
desired wholesale mechanisms; 
·
Replicable models for urban services delivery, particularly in the efficient, equitable and 
sustainable provision of water supply and sanitation, housing and related environmental 
infrastructure, integrated with effective municipal environmental management; 
·
A
model for using urban environmental infrastructure investments as a vehicle for more effective 
social policies and programs at the municipal level, where such integration is seen to be effective 
and where this can advance federal or state objectives at the local level; 
·
Effective mechanisms for cross-fertilization and comparison of outcomes across the range of 
municipal beneficiaries by building a system of monitoring and evaluation; and 
Page  2
·
Improved municipal management and governance and the local level, including fiscal 
management, so as to ensure the sustainability of the investments and to serve as national models 
in these areas. 
 
In addition, each individual operation, while contributing to these broader cross-cutting objectives and 
expectations of replicability, will have their own specific objectives and expected outcomes
.
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed program responds to a growing demand among municipal governments seeking 
financing for investments in environmental infrastructure and urban upgrading, together with 
institutional support to improve municipal level environmental management and local governance.  
As indicated previously, such an approach suppo
rts both the Bank and the GOB’s strategy of 
integrating and coordinating infrastructure investments with institutional work in related activities 
such as urban planning/management, solid waste management, drainage, health, land use planning, 
environmental protection governance and regulation and complementary social sectors.  This is an 
explicit strategy to allow for consistent policies across sectors, reduce wasted resources resulting from 
a
lack of cooperation and to capture the consequent cumulative benefits of effective coordination.  
 
A
Pooled Approach
:
It is proposed that the project take the form of a pooled lending program of 
municipal support.  Therefore, the intervention would be developed as an Horizontal APL, that would 
finance investments in integrated urban environmental infrastructure and shelter consistent with the 
overriding development objective.  The first phase of the APL would be the four municipal loans 
approved by COFIEX in November 2003:  Uberaba (Minas Gerais); Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais); 
Recife (Pernambuco) and Teresina (Piaui).  Each loan in the first phase would be prepared separately 
and at its own pace, according to the preparedness of the Borrower and the project.  Each municipal 
loan would have a Federal Government guarantee.  The umbrella concept for the horizontal APL 
would be presented to the Board together with the project(s) that is (are) prepared first, indicating that 
this would be one phase of a series of municipal loans to be developed under the APL, all following a 
similar line of development (i.e. urban environmental infrastructure/management and shelter with 
important social and governance elements), with the intention that all future loans under the umbrella 
would be approved through a streamlined approval process. 
 
It is anticipated that the APL would be done in three phases:  Phase I
would be the first set of four 
municipal loans for delivery in FY 05; Phase II
a
second set of municipal loans for delivery in FY 06; 
and a Phase III
for delivery in FY 07.  With each sub-loan having an average implementation period 
of five years, it expected that the lending program would have a life of  eight years. 
 
While triggers for subsequent phases will still need to be developed, a minimum set of triggers for 
phases II and III would include: 
 
·
An agreement with SEAIN on criteria for selecting future municipalities that will borrow 
from the World Bank to ensure a consistent pipeline of projects sharing development 
priorities; 
·
An evaluation of the process of preparing and approving the first and second packages of 
municipal loans in order to gauge the commitment of the government and the potential 
bottlenecks in the approval process of municipal loans; 
·
Adoption of an internal (Bank) City Strategy that will set the course for the longer-term Bank 
strategy for municipal lending in Brazil. 
·
A
strategy for wholesaling mechanism(s) for municipal lending in Brazil.

A
Holistic Approach
:
In addition to the natural integration between urban environmental 
management and urban infrastructure, working at the municipal level presents other opportunities to 
provide a holistic, cross-sector program of support to the municipality.  Therefore, each of the 
municipal operations will evaluate the possibilities for further cross-sector integration.  Among the 
options are institutional capacity and local governance to improve municipal management, in part to 
ensure the sustainability of the investments.  Social interventions are another area of priority, 
including effective targeting of subsidy programs (e.g. making Bolsa Family more effective at the 
local level), in addition to potential discrete components for specific investments in health, education 
and social inclusion.  Improving the efficiency of public service provision is a constant objective in 
all of the interventions.  Each package of support will be tailor made to the needs and demands of the 
municipality. 
 
A
Broader Strategy
:
The proposed operation fits within a broader strategy to attend the growing 
municipal demand for Bank support to finance integrated urban environmental infrastructure, shelter 
and complementary activities.  To address the lack of long-term, flexible financing in the domestic 
market for municipal infrastructure and municipal services in Brazil the Bank has begun preparation 
of an urban  municipal operational strategy.  The strategy includes: 
 
·
A
short-term
program of direct (eg. Betim) and pooled Loans (Horizontal APL) that provide 
financing to municipal governments for integrated urban environmental infrastructure 
projects; 
·
The medium-term
development of wholesale mechanisms to use Bank funds to leverage other 
public and private sector capital to deepen the local capital market for municipal 
infrastructure financing (currently working with BNB and in future with CAIXA and others); 
and    
·
development of a Urban Municipal Strategy that will, based on strong urban analytical work 
and stakeholder consultations, lay-out a longer-term
vision and strategy for Bank work at the 
municipal level in the urban space. 
 
Phase I Projects:  The sub-loans in the first phase of the APL include the municipalities of: 
 
Uberaba (Agua Viva, US$29.42M; US$17.65M loan amount):
This is a medium-sized municipality 
(+250,000 pop.) in the state of Minas Gerais.  The project will focus on water resources management, 
universal WS&S (including collection and treatment), macro-drainage and environmental protection 
of the Uberaba River Basin Environmental Protection Area.  It will include efforts to strengthen local 
environmental management capacity, as well as local  governance and fiscal management.  Improving 
overall efficiency of the municipal water company is another aspect of the project. 
Belo Horizonte (Villas Urbanizadas; US$51.67M; US$31.0M loan amount):
This is the capital and 
largest city in the state of Minas Gerais.  The project will lay the foundation for a large-scale, city-
wide program of slum urbanization, linking with the municipality’s efforts at social inclusion and 
water pollution control (the latter two efforts financed by IDB loans).  It will also include a 
component of early childhood education, focused on the two initial project areas, and will include 
components in governance and fiscal management.  This individual loan may also be developed as its 
own APL to scale-up the Vilas Urbanizadas program and the early childhood development efforts, 
both priorities of the municipality, in its subsequent phases.   
Recife (Capibaribe Melhor; US$46.8M; 32.76M loan amount):
Recife is the capital of the state of 
Pernambuco and has the highest percentage of informal settlements of any city in Brazil.  This project 
will support the sustainable development and revitalization of the Capibaribe River Basin in the 
municipality of Recife, one of the city’s most important natural resources, and an important mixed-
income community.  It includes resettlement, urban development, sanitation and environmental 
Page  4
management.  It complements the on-going Bank financed work in the Beberibe River Basin, and is a 
priority recommendation of the Metropolitan City Development Strategy.  This project includes 
specific social components in employment and job creation and will also explore the inclusion of 
governance, fiscal management and social targeting.  A key aspect of this program will be to 
rationalize the integrated development of an important area of the city, while also focusing on 
improving the efficiency of municipal services, in particular WS&S. 
Teresina (Lagoas do Norte; 40.43M, 28.30M loan amount):
Teresina is the capital of Piauí.  The 
project will build on the award winning Villa Bairro program, by supporting a program of favela 
upgrading, urban development, sanitation, social inclusion, economic development and environmental 
management to the Lagoas do Norte Region.  The program includes components of metropolitan 
planning, local governance and data base development for targeting of social programs, among 
others.  A key aspect of this project is the improvement in the provision of WS&S services through 
development of a model concession contract for these services.
