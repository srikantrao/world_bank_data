                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The proposed development objective is to strengthen the capacity of members of ASEANSAI
                           through accelerated implementation of ISSAIs in each member country.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project will consist of three components: (1) Workshop on ISSAI implementation focusing on
                           Internal Control Systems and Risk-Based Audit; (2) Certification of ISSAI Facilitators; (3)
                           Monitoring and Evaluation.
                           Component 1: Workshop on ISSAI implementation focusing on Internal Control Systems (IC) and
                           Risk-Based Audit (RBA). Based on the needs identified in Bandung on August 18, 2014 that
                           identified challenges to implement some standards. A workshop for 30 financial auditors will be held
                           on the theme IC/RBA Workshop. The workshop will be delivered by the existing 11 ASEANSAI
                           ISSAI Facilitators. They will be supported by subject matter expert from SAI Sweden and Training
                           Specialists from IDI. The workshop will be followed by a pilot audit implemented by the participants
                           in their respective SAIs. Assistance will be provided to the SAIs who are unable to apply ISSAI on
                           the pilot audit through twinning of with a more experienced SAI. Thus establishing a mechanism for
                           peer learning will supplement the classroom workshop. The workshop and the pilot audit will
                           provide the participants with a good basis of theoretical and practical knowledge on ISSAI
                           implementation. This will be complemented through the second component with further training on

                           ISSAI and facilitation skills in order to award an IDI-Certificate to the 30 financial auditors.
                           Component 2: Certification- Using IDI training materials, PIU will organize the certification of the
                           30 financial auditors. It will be imparted by IDI staff. The training will be on Training of Trainers
                           (TOT) mode and the trained facilitators will then share their knowledge with auditors inside their
                           respective organizations. The certified auditors will integrate the ASEANSAI ISSAI Facilitators Pool
                           to share knowledge and sustain the ISSAI implementation.
                           Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation - The database on the certified ISSAI facilitators will be
                           maintained on ASEANSAI website. A year after the implementation of the grant, an analysis will be
                           carried out to review the ISSAI implementation. If the project is successful, a second project could be
                           considered to increase the Pool of ISSAI Facilitators further.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The Project Management Unit will be in ASEANSAI secretariat that is located in Jakarta, Indonesia.
                           However, the project's activities may take place in other capital city of ASEANSAI member
                           countries. There is no activities that relevant to the Bank safeguard policy.
                           E. Borrowerâ€™s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           Since all project activities do not have direct link to the Bank safeguard requirements. Hence the
                           recipient does not need to fulfill safeguard requirement or establish institutional capacity for
                           safeguard policies.
