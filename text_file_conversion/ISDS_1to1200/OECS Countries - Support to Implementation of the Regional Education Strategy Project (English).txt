   B. Project Development Objective(s)
   The Project Development Objectives are the following: (i) establish and use quality learning
   standards to support evidence based teaching and learning; (ii) improve teacher effectiveness in the
   classroom at the primary level; and (iii) strengthen school leadership and accountability.


   C. Project Description
   Proposed instrument: The proposed instrument would be a Recipient-Executed Trust Fund (RETF)
   arrangement between the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) and the World Bank in the amount
   of US$2,000,000 for four countries. There is also a possibility of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
   and Saint Lucia allocating some IDA resources to education activities under the OECS HD
   Resilience Project, and those resources will build on and scale up the proposed activities under this
   Grant. Preliminary discussions have led to an education component structure consisting of four sub
   components.
  Curriculum and Assessment. The project will support the following activities: (i) review of the
  harmonized curriculum to clarify grade level learning standards for primary education in literacy,
  numeracy, science and social studies; and (ii) develop a learner-centered assessment framework
  including formative assessment; (iii) develop and implement guidelines for using learning standards
  and formative classroom assessment.

  Teacher professional development. This component will support the following activities: (i) review
  of teacher training programs; (ii) review classroom practices to identify capacity gaps; (iii) develop a
  teacher professional development program to improve classroom practices, including formative
  assessment, student/teacher interaction and use of student learning data; (iv) competence-based
  professional development for teachers through training on effective classroom practices, formative
  assessment in line with learning standards and use of student learning data; (v) establish an on-line
  community of practice for teachers to access on-line instructional resources, share lesson plans, and
  experiences.

  Improve school leadership and accountability. This component will support the following activities:
  (i) develop a program for training of school leaders based on agreed professional standards, including
  instructional leadership and to support teachers to improve instructional practices; (ii) competence
  based training and certification of school leaders based on leadership standards, including on
  instructional leadership and use of data, including in planning, management and reporting; (iii)
  develop a handbook for school principals/leaders to guide school leadership and management.

  Project implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Framework for generating data on select
  indicators (including pedagogical practices) and reporting regularly on progress towards the
  attainment of expected results.
  D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
     analysis (if known)
  E. The project does not trigger any social safeguards. No civil works, or other activities that would
       lead to involuntary resettlement or land acquisition will be supported. In addition, although
       Dominica, which has an Indigenous Population, is a participating country, the project is not
       supporting any physical interventions at the country or school level – only activities related to the
       review and creation of regional frameworks in support of the OECS education strategy.
