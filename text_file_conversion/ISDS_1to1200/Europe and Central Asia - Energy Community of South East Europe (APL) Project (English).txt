A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of ECSEE APL is the development of a functioning regional electricity 
market in South East Europe and its integration into the internal electricity market of the 
European Union, through the implementation of priority investments supporting 
electricity market and power system operations in electricity generation, transmission and 
distribution and technical assistance for institutional/systems development and project 
preparation and implementation.    
 
ECSEE is an integral element of ECSEE’s Regional Members’ and the European 
Commission’s efforts for all states in South East Europe to have access to stable and 
continuous energy supply which they regard as essential for economic development and 
social stability.  The creation of an area without internal frontiers for energy contributes 
to economic and social progress and a high level of employment as well as balanced and 
sustainable development.  These higher level objectives are expressed in the draft ECSEE 
Treaty. 
 
All SEE countries have the prospect of EU membership.   Accordingly, the Member 
Countries and the Commission are resolved to establish tightly integrated energy markets 
in electricity and gas based on a common solidarity and consistent principles, closely 
linked to the internal market of the European Union, and fully complying with the rules 
applicable within the Union. 
 
The Stability Pact has made regional energy cooperation one of its core objectives in its 
efforts to strengthen regional cooperation and to foster the conditions for peace, stability 
and economic growth in the South East Europe.   The Stability Pact has characterized 
Page  2
ECSEE as a unique political chance for the SEE region, to consolidate reconciliation and 
provide a power driver towards a more comprehensive economic and political integration 
into the European Union. 
 
The Bank supports regional efforts to promote cooperation and integration in South East 
Europe.  ECSEE is one of the most prominent of current regional programs.  The 
proposed APL facility is a key component of the Bank’s support for the Stability Pact and 
the working partnership with the European Commission. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Eligible ECSEE APL project components
.
The Bank’s March 2004 framework paper 
1
concluded that significant investments in power generation, transmission and distribution 
and technical assistance are required for a well-functioning power market.   Priority 
investments and technical assistance would be financed under the ECSEE APL program 
so that the ECSEE Regional Members can effectively participate in the regional 
electricity market: 
 
·
Investments to ensure that ECSEE Regional Member meet the integration 
requirements of UCTE - the Union for the Coordination of Transmission of 
Electricity in Europe; 
·
Investments to upgrade the capabilities of transmission system operators (TSOs) 
of ECSEE Regional Members so that they can implement policy decisions to 
assure regional security of supply.  Examples of such investments include:  (a) 
upgrading load dispatch and real-time system stability and control capabilities 
(
e.g. the proposed APL 1 investments by TEIAS in SCADA/EMS systems
); (b) 
upgrading infrastructure/systems for electricity market administration (
e.g. the 
proposed APL 1 investments by TEIAS in a market management system for 
balancing and/or ancillary service transactions, settlements, etc
.); and (c) 
removing critical bottlenecks in transmission networks and sub-stations (
e.g. the 
proposed APL 1 investments by TEIAS in transmission networks and sub-
stations
); 
·
Investment to restore operational capacity/flexibility of critical generation 
facilities that provide ancillary services to TSOs (
e.g. the proposed APL 1 
investments to rehabilitate Hidroelectrica’s Lotru Hydropower Station  in 
Romania
); 
·
Investment in retrofits of critical generation and/or transmission facilities to 
assure environmental compliance; 
·
Metering and/or telecommunications programs designed to enhance revenue 
realization and/or coordination and communications capabilities of distribution

utilities so that they can more effectively participate in the regional power market; 
and 
·
A
wide range of technical assistance, for institutional/systems development and 
project preparation and implementation, to support ECSEE Regional Members in 
energy market design and implementation assistance, 
inter alia
 to ensure full 
compliance with the ECSEE framework/EU directives and compatibility of 
market designs for the supply of balancing services and/or ancillary services 
across SEE country frontiers; and engineering/environmental services for the 
preparation and implementation of investment projects (including but not limited 
to projects financed by the Bank under the ECSEE APL) for a functioning 
electricity market.  
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
APL1 investment projects
 consist of two country projects, Romania and Turkey.  The 
Romania
 project has one component: the rehabilitation of Hidroelectrica’s Lotru 
hydropower station.   The 510 MW hydro power station will be rehabilitated into a 
reliable source of ancillary services.  The 
Turkey
 project supports the implementation of 
several elements of the investment programs of the National Transmission Company 
TEIAS.  First, a Market Management System (MMS)  would be created for TEIAS, for 
the management of the electricity market in Turkey. Second, its SCADA/EMS 
(supervisory control and data acquisition/energy management system) would be 
strengthened so that TEIAS would be in a  position to operate its system more efficiently 
and to coordinate with other SEE systems operators in order to meet overall stability and 
control requirements.  Third, the project would provide transmission grid strengthening 
and expansion for overall stability. This includes funding some of TEIAS  network and 
sub-stations investments

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The classification of the ECSEE APL program and APL1 is FI.   Most of the country-
level investment projects are expected to be B-category projects.  Romania/Lotru and the 
currently identified Turkey project elements are all B-category projects.  However, 
individual country-level investment projects included in the later installments of the APL 
program may contain components that would be rated into the A-category or C-category.  
APL1 is rated FI because not all of the project elements in the Turkey/TEIAS component 
have been identified.   Though they are all expected to be B-category or C-category, an 
Environmental Framework Document (EFD) and a Land Acquisition Management 
Framework (LAMF) outlining what principal actions will be taken by TEIAS in regard to 
different foreseen but not yet identified elements have been prepared.  The EFD and 
LAMF also outline how the issues related to public participation and disclosure of 
information are handled. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
APL1 projects are not expected to have adverse indirect and/or long term impacts. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
NA - Not applicable 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Romania/Lotru
.
Hidroelectrica has prepared an Environmental Management Plan 
(EMP) for the Lotru rehabilitation project. The EMP  was reviewed by the World Bank 
and was fully consistent with World Bank EA requirements.
 
Lotru is an existing hydro 
power development on the Lotru river.  Lotru is the most important provider of ancillary 
services 
2
for the opera
tion of Romania’s power system.  It was built in the 1960s/early 
1970s and commissioned in 1972
-
75.  The capacity of the Lotru power station is 510

Ancillary services (such as frequency support, reactive power, and spinning reserve) are 
required for the safe and reliable operation of power systems
.

MW (from three Pelton turbines of 170 MW each).  The source of water for the hydro 
plant is the Vidra reservoir, which was created as part of the Lotru development.  The 
condition and continued safety of the Vidra dam is under continuous monitoring and 
regular maintenance and the dam is in good condition.  However, after three decades of 
demanding heavy-duty operation as the key provider of ancillary services,  the hydro 
plant is overdue for extensive rehabilitation.  The project is located about 140 meters 
underground.   The rehabilitation of the Lotru station will have only minor environmental 
and no social impacts, and will consist of replacing hydroelectric and hydromechanical  
equipment. One of the transformers to be replaced contains polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs) as a heat transfer medium. The EMP includes this issue and the mitigation 
proposed is consistent with international practice.   Other minor impacts are associated 
with  the disposal of outdated equipment which will be replaced under the project.  An  
The EMP has been prepared, finalized after public consultations. have been held.  A 
Romanian language version of the EMP has been disclosed in-country and the English 
language version of the EMP It has been cleared by the Bank and submitted to the 
InfoShop. 
 
Turkey/TEIAS
.
The TEIAS project has a limited environmental impact.  The 
SCADA/EMS and MMS systems, which consist of hardware and software, have no 
significant impact. Rehabilitation of substations and upgrading of transmission lines 
would also have little or no impact since the substations are reported not to have PCBs.  
New substations would have a minor impact.  TEIAS has prepared an Environmental 
Management Framework (EMF) indicating how it will review and address the 
environmental impact of its investments.  This framework document has been cleared by 
the Bank and submitted to the InfoShop.   
 
The TEIAS project has limited social impacts.   There is no resettlement but there will be 
limited land acquisition.  The market management system (MMS) and EMS/SCADA for 
TEIAS involve no social issues or land acquisition.   The substation component for 
TEIAS may  involve a minor amount of land acquisition for new substations as needed.  
TEIAS has an existing policy for land acquisition which involves payment of market 
prices for the land acquired and allows the land owner to go to court if not satisfied with 
the amount paid.  The amount of land required under the project is, however, very small 
since the number of sub-stations is limited and the required plots are small (for the base 
of transmission towers).  It is not anticipated that there would be any new transmission 
lines financed under APL 1.  A Land Acquisition Policy Framework (LAPF) has been 
prepared by TEIAS indicating how it will handle land acquisition issues.  This framework 
document has been cleared by the Bank and submitted to the InfoShop.   
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Romania/Lotru
.
Key stakeholders are people living in the vicinity of the project area.  
Hidroelectrica had conducted consultations in accordance with Romanian requirements 
earlier.  During 2004, Hidroelectrica repeated public consultations in the area, in a 
Page  6
manner satisfactory to the Bank. 
 
Turkey/TEIAS projects
.
The EMF and LAPF procedures incorporate public 
consultations meeting which meet both Turkish and World Bank environmental and 
social safeguard policies and procedures.
