                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The primary objective of our engagement is to contribute to government's efforts to improve the
                           capacity of the internal audit institutions to meet the level 3 of IA-CM requirements.

                           Internal Audit Capability Model (IA-CM) is a framework that identifies the fundamentals needed for
                           effective internal auditing in government and the broader public sector. It illustrates the levels and
                           stages through which an intern audit activity can evolve as it defines, implements, measures, controls
                           and improves its processes and practices. The IA-CM provides a road map for continuous
                           improvement in processes and practices to establish effective internal auditing in an organization.

                           There are 5 capability levels in IA-CM, where level 1 is the lowest with no sustainability and high
                           dependency on individual efforts and level 5 is the inspirational level. Level 3 is where internal audit
                           management and professional practices are uniformly applied and the practice generally conforms to
                           the internal audit standards and an established Quality Assurance Improvement Program (QAIP) .

                           Level 3 of IA-CM requires advisory services and performance audit to be practiced uniformly and
                           the use of risk based audit plan within the internal audit institutions. To ensure such internal audit
                           professional practice, qualified IA-CM accessors and certified QAIP reviewers should be available to
                           support such transformation.
