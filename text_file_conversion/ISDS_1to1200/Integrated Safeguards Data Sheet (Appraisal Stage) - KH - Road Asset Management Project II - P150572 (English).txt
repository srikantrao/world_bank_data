                                                                        Page 1 of 12
                         climate proofing and road safety measures and the use of performance based contracts; and (ii) by
                         enhancing MPWT’s capacity to carry out road maintenance planning, contracting and management.
                         3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The RAMP-II project is designed to build on the achievements of RAMP to ensure the continued
                         effective use of the rehabilitated national and provincial road network. In so doing, the follow-on
                         project would improve the climate resilience and longevity of 218 km of existing bitumen-sealed
                         roads with an overlay of asphalt concrete, replacement of current pavement with concrete pavement
                         at flood prone areas, including strengthening and replacement, as necessary, of sub-base and road
                         base-course, using unbound materials or stabilized materials for the road pavement of National
                         Roads (NR) 3 and 7, and installation of about 90 km of side-drainage in flood prone areas along the
                         roads. The new project would support planning and development of the road maintenance program
                         by further enhancing the capacity of MPWT to carry out the data collection, processing and analysis
                         necessary for effective road asset management of the national and provincial road networks. The
                         project would also provide ongoing support to community-based road safety and HIV/AIDs and
                         human trafficking awareness campaigns.

                         The project has three main components.

                         Component A: Road Asset Management

                         This component will support the preservation of MPWT’s road network and provide implementation
                         support for the design and supervision of works.

                         A.1: Periodic maintenance and Performance Based Contracts (PBCs) for routine maintenance will be
                         undertaken for 218 km of existing bitumen-sealed roads with an overlay of asphalt concrete,
                         replacement of current pavement with concrete pavement at flood prone areas, including
                         strengthening and replacement, as necessary, of sub-base and road base-course, using unbound
                         materials or stabilized materials for the road pavement. The civil works would include about 90 km

                         of installation of new drains on both sides of the road. Periodic maintenance would be followed by
                         the application of performance-based road maintenance for a period of three years. Periodic
                         maintenance works would be divided into four contract packages, one on NR3 and three on NR7.

                         A.2: Implementation support for the civil works under the project and related technical capacity
                         building activities including: (a) advice to MPWT on technical options and solutions, cost estimation;
                         contract management and safeguard activities for the civil works under Component A.1; (b)
                         construction supervision of the civil works throughout the project; (c) supervision of PBCs for the
                         civil works under the project and; (d) hands-on development of technical capacities of MPWT staff
                         on good practices and internationally accepted procedures, systems and standards for road
                         construction, road safety, project management, contract management, outsourcing, PBC, social and
                         environmental management, monitoring and evaluation, and financial and technical auditing.

                         Component B: System Upgrading and Capacity Development

                         A.2 This component will support: (1) System upgrading and technical capacity development for road
                         asset management within the MPWT through support for (i) operation of the Road Data Collection
                         and Management Unit (RDCMU) under RAMO and the effective implementation of the Road
                         Management Decision Support (RMDS) system; (ii) strengthening of the data collection
                         methodology, review of the current modeling system, and provision of simplified models for


                                                                     Page 2 of 12
                         development of three-year rolling maintenance plans if required; and (iii) development of a useful
                         reporting format for the results of model simulation, and training; (2) Road safety awareness raising
                         of communities and road safety audits of project roads; (3) Enhancement of financial management

                         and internal audit capacities of MPWT and the project team; (4) Carrying out of technical and
                         financial audits of the Project; (5) Provision of technical assistance to enhance RAMO’s procurement
                         capacity; and (6) Provision of operational and technical support for the day-to-day management,
                         monitoring and evaluation of Project activities.

                         Component C: Contingent Emergency Response

                         This component will enable immediate response through the reallocation of project proceeds in the
                         event of an eligible crisis or emergency. If Component 3 is triggered, then the Standard Immediate
                         Response Mechanism - Contingent Emergency Response Component (IRM CERC)-specific
                         objective of “provide immediate and effective response to an Eligible Crisis or Emergency” will be
                         incorporated and the results framework revised as part of a Level Two restructuring.

                         As with RAMP, RAMP-II will be implemented using the existing Royal Government of Cambodia
                         (RGC) organizational structure and institutional arrangements, particularly within MPWT. The same
                         unit that managed and supervised activities for RAMP will be responsible for RAMP-II investments.
                         The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) will be the formal point of contact between RGC and
                         IDA on all financial and legal matters related to the Credit for the Project, and will represent RGC in
                         discussions on these matters. The MPWT will be responsible for overall technical supervision,
                         execution and management of the project. The General Department of Public Works (GDPW) will be
                         responsible for the day to-day implementation, supervision and operation of the project, including
                         contracting and direction of all consultants, and will be the employer for all civil works contracts.
                         The General Department of Administration and Planning (GDAP) will carry out the financial,
                         safeguards, capacity development, training and public disclosure matters on the project. The General
                         Department of Transport (GDT) will be responsible for Road Safety aspects.

                         The RAMP-II will be implemented for a period of 6 years, from 2016 to 2022.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will cover the repair and maintenance of four sections of NR3 (one package) located in
                         the southern part of Cambodia from Kampot municipality to Veal Rinh district, and of NR7 (three
                         packages) in Kampong Cham located in the central region. The works will be under MPWT’s
                         responsibility as detailed below:

                         �       Package 1: Periodic maintenance of 54 km of NR3 from KP147.1 to KP201.4 from Kampot
                         provincial town to Veal Rinh intersection of NR3 and NR4, with performance based contract
                         covering routine maintenance for three years. It also supports the construction of side drains of 17
                         km along the NR3 road.
                         �       Package 2: Periodic maintenance of 50 km of NR7 from KP136 to KP186, with performance
                         based contract covering routine maintenance for three years. It also supports the construction of both
                         side drains along 28.7 km of the NR7 road.
                         �       Package 3: Periodic maintenance of 57 km of NR7 from KP186 to KP243, with performance
                         based contract covering routine maintenance for three years. It also supports the construction of both
                         side drains along 37.7 km of the NR7 road.
                         �       Package 4: Periodic maintenance of 57 km of NR7 from KP243 to KP300, with performance


                                                                      Page 3 of 12
                         based contract covering routine maintenance for three years. It also supports the construction of both
                         side drains along 11.8 km along of the NR7 road.

                         The road sections are located in a flat area connecting a number of provincial and district towns (i.e.,
                         Kampot and Veal Rinh districts on NR 3 and Kampong Cham, Suong, Memot, and Snoul on NR7).
                         These areas are characterized by rapid growth, economic development and increasing demand for in-
                         land transport. The project will focus on preservation of the existing assets and will not involve any
                         civil works or expansion beyond the current public rights of way (ROW).

                         The MPWT carried out environmental and social screening along the two National Roads for
                         RAMP-II in November 2013. During the field survey, the ministry also conducted consultations with
                         Project Affected Households (PAHs) along NR7 during November 10-13, 2013 and along NR 3 on
                         November 15, 2013. Outcomes of the screening process, documented in the report dated November
                         20, 2013, reveal that no major environmental and social impacts are envisaged because the proposed
                         road maintenance sections will be carried out within the existing road alignments and ROWs. Some
                         inconveniences may occur during construction, such as dust, noise, construction debris and short
                         term disturbance to the daily business activities; these, however, can be mitigated by applying good
                         construction practices and close supervision. The safeguard screening also confirms that no major
                         physical resettlement would be required, and no ethnic groups of people were found in the project
                         areas. Nevertheless, minor relocation of temporary structures/assets exposed to the ROW, such as
                         shop roofs, small tree branches, hawkers, and cement mortar made-floors extended from small shops
                         or stalls along the ROW, are anticipated.

                         The earlier findings were reconfirmed in a second field survey conducted by the MPWT in
                         December 2015. Out of 919 households visited by the safeguard screening team, 92 (14 along NR3
                         and 78 along NR7) were identified with their temporary small structures and assets to be potentially
                         affected by the RAMP-II activities. Two ARAPs were prepared with impact mitigation measures and
                         implementation arrangements provided to address the social impacts on these 92 PAHs. The other
                         827 households could potentially experience dust, noise, construction debris and short term

                         disturbance to the daily business activities during the civil work. These impacts can be mitigated by
                         applying Environmental Management Plans (EMPs), which outline good construction practices and
                         supervision arrangement.

                         No ethnic minority people were identified among 919 potential PAHs visited during the screening for
                         the RAMP-II. However, it was decided that the Indigenous Peoples Development Framework (IPDF)
                         developed under the original project would remain applicable for RAMP-II for precautionary
                         reasons. Ethnic screening will be conducted for all road sections to be supported under the project
                         during detailed survey and design and before civil works start. If ethnic minority groups are found to
                         be present in or have collective attachment to project areas, an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan
                         (IPDP) will be developed as per the updated IPPF.

                         No un-exploded ordinance (UXO) was found during the original RAMP and risks due to UXOs in
                         the project areas were mitigated through the previous road projects.

                         These findings were reviewed by the Bank’s safeguard mission conducted for the road sections under

                         The original RAMP safeguard documents have been slightly updated to reflect the name and nature
                         of the new project, and that RAMP-II will be solely financed by the bank. The revision also
                         incorporates lessons learned from the RAMP and other projects (see further in the updated ESSF and

                         conflicting with the Bank policy OP. 4.12. The RCPF and IPDF are also integrated into the ESSF to
                         address potential impacts on land acquisition or asset loss, or on ethnic minority groups. These
                         safeguards instruments will be applied during RAMP-II for effective consultation and public
                         disclosure.

                         Since all four road packages are known in terms of locations and impacts, in November 2014 MPWT
                         prepared two Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plans (ARAPs) and site specific EMPs for these
                         packages in line with the updated ESSF. The ARAPs, EMPs and ESSF were again updated by
                         MPWT through the final round of field assessment combined with free, prior and informed
                         consultations carried out during December 16-17, 2015. The updated ARAPs were re-disclosed on
                         January 18, 2016 which include the complete form of signed agreement on voluntary donation by
                         PAHs. These updated safeguard documents were reviewed by the Bank’s safeguard specialists. The
                         reassessment identified 14 PAHs along NR3 and 78 along NR7 with temporary small structures and
                         assets that could potentially be affected by the project activities, and measures were provided in the
                         two ARAPs to mitigate the impacts. The assessment also confirmed that no Physical Cultural
                         Resources (PCR) were involved along both NR3 and NR7. Although no ethnic minority people were

                         identified among the 919 PAHs visited during the safeguard screenings, it was decided that the IPDF
                         developed under the original project would remain applicable for RAMP-II and ethnic screening will
                         be conducted for all four road sections before civil works start. If ethnic minority groups are found
                         to be present in or have collective attachment to project areas, then an Indigenous Peoples
                         Development Plan (IPDP) will be developed as per the updated IPPF.

                         The site specific EMPs, ARAPs and ESSF have been updated and translated into Khmer language.
                         These safeguard documents were disclosed on MPWT's website on December 23, 2015 and Bank
                         Infoshop on December 23 and 24, 2015 and will be incorporated in the bidding documents of civil
                         work contracts.

                                                        Potential minor and temporary impacts are anticipated due
                                                        to the construction of side ditches and drainage within the
                                                        ROW. The impacts would include temporary disturbance
                                                        in daily accessing to shops/restaurants along the roads,

                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The implementing agency, MPWT, carried out environmental and social screening and assessment
                              along the two national roads three times, in November 2013, November 2014 and in December
                              2015. During the field surveys, the ministry also conducted free, prior and informed consultations
                              with Project Affected Households (PAHs) along the two national roads to establish their broad
                              support for the project. Outcomes of the screening process documented in the report dated
                              November 20, 2013 reveals that no major environmental and social impacts are and concerns
                              envisaged because the proposed road maintenance sections will be carried out on the existing road
                              alignments and within the ROW. Some inconveniences may occur during construction such as
                              dust, noise, construction debris and short term disturbance to the daily business activities, which
                              however can be mitigated by applying good construction practices and close supervision. The
                              safeguard screening also confirms that no physical resettlement would be required and no ethnic
                              groups of people were found in the project areas. Nevertheless, minor relocation of temporary
                              structures/assets exposed to the ROW such as shop roof, small tree branches, hawkers, and cement
                              mortar made-floors extended from small shops or stalls along the ROW are anticipated. Since all
                              four road packages are known in terms of locations and impacts, in November 2014, MPWT was
                              advised to reassessed the impacts along both NR3 and NR7, and prepared Abbreviated RAPs
                              (ARAPs) and site specific EMPs, which were reviewed by the Bank's safeguard specialists. As a
                              result, 14 PAHs on NR3 and 78 PAHs on NR7 were identified with their temporary structures and
                              assets to be potentially affected by the project activities and impact mitigation measures are
                              provided in the ARAPs to be applied under the RAMP-II.

                             No ethnic minority people were identified among 919 potential PAHs visited in during safeguard
                             screening in the three different periods. Similarly, no un-exploded ordinance (UXO) was found
                             during the original RAMP and risks due to UXO in the project areas were mitigated through the
                             previous road projects.

                             In December 2015, a final round of safeguard assessment was carried out by MPWT and revealed
                             that no additional environmental and social impacts and concerns along both NR3 and NR7 are
                             anticipated, thanks to the endorsement and enforcement of Law on Road (May 2014). The ESSF,
                             ARAPs, and site specific EMPs were slightly revised to reflect the final reduced scope of project
                             activities and lessons learned from original project (See further details in PAD, Annex 3).

                              The findings of safeguard assessments and the updated package of safeguard instruments (ESSF,
                              ARAPs and site specific EMPs) were reviewed and found adequate by the Bank safeguard
                              specialists. These updated documents (including TEG) were disclosed on MPWT's website on
                              December 23, in project areas, and in the Bank’s InfoShop on December 23 and 24, 2015 .
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                              The improvement of the two national roads may result in an increase in traffic, number of vehicles


                                                                        Page 8 of 12
                           and driving speeds. The rehabilitated roads are expected to facilitate economic activities and
                           growth due to improved accessibility and connectivity. The new roads are also expected to bring
                           about increased migration to the project area, especially to both sides of the improved roads. There

                           are a number of potential indirect and/or long term social impacts due to the anticipated future
                           activities in the project areas. These include, but should not be limited to, increased road accidents,
                           human trafficking and HIV/AID incidents. To address these and other impacts, a HIV/AIDS and
                           human trafficking awareness program, a road safety program, and a safeguard training and
                           capacity building program applied by the original project will be continued under RAMP-II.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           The alternative to the proposed road maintenance program is a no maintenance, or “do nothing”
                           scenario. This scenario would have adverse environmental implications. Lack of maintenance
                           could generate unstable road bed conditions leading to localized erosion and drainage problems in
                           addition to poor quality roads that can generate accidents, especially during the night time. In areas
                           of high rainfall and geologic instability, these risks can be substantial. Road maintenance
                           programs provide an opportunity to address some basic design problems.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The findings and outcomes of the above safeguard screening and review indicate that the
                           safeguard instruments applied for the original RAMP, namely Environment and Social Safeguard
                           Framework (ESSF) including generic Environmental Management Plan (EMP), would still be
                           relevant and applicable for RAMP-II.

                           With detailed survey and design of the road sections completed after the concept stage, locations
                           and scope of potential impacts are known, site specific Environmental Management Plans (EMPs)
                           and Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plans (ARAP) have been prepared for the RAMP-II in line
                           with the revised ESSF. MPWT will ensure that, together with TEG, the EMP and site specific
                           EMPs will be applied by contractors to address and mitigate the identified environmental and

                           health impacts that may result from the civil works through the effective project management and
                           systematic monitoring system established. The EMPs provide a set of impact mitigation measures
                           and good engineering practice, monitoring and reporting requirements. The results of the final
                           round of field re-assessment carried out from December 16-17 2015, a survey conducted by the
                           MPWT, suggests that a total 92 PAHs were identified (14 households along NR3 and 78
                           households along NR7) to be potentially affected by the project due to the loss of assets, incomes
                           and businesses. The ARAPs are therefore prepared for the impact mitigation and compensation for
                           any asset and income losses. The ARAPs are to ensure that the affected persons receive the
                           support required to restore their livelihoods and incomes at least to pre-project levels and
                           consequently that they are not worse off as a result of the road subproject implementation.
                           Although no ethnic groups were found during the three rounds of safeguard screening and
                           assessments, it was decided that the Indigenous Peoples Development Framework (IPDF)
                           developed under the original project would remain applicable for RAMP-II for precautionary
                           reasons. Ethnic screening was conducted as part of the above assessments for all road sections to
                           be supported under the project, also during detail survey and design, and will be revisited before
                           civil works start. If ethnic minority groups are found to be present in or have collective attachment
                           to project areas, an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) will be developed as per the
                           updated IPPF.

                           MPWT has gained extensive experience in road construction and rehabilitation while

                                                                      Page 9 of 12
                           implementing donor supported projects including RAMP. Accordingly MPWT recognizes the
                           importance of environmental protection and has demonstrated firm commitment to mitigating
                           potential environmental and social impacts, especially under RAMP. During RAMP-II project

                           preparation, MPWT (i) conducted three rounds of environmental and social screening throughout
                           the proposed road sections and consulted with potentially affected households to identify potential
                           impacts, inform them of the project, and obtain their feedback and concerns; (ii) updated the
                           existing safeguard policy frameworks on resettlement and indigenous peoples applied by the
                           original project; and (iii) updated the ESSF describing the screening criteria, the EMP, the CRPF
                           and IPDF for the project and Technical Environmental Guidelines (TEG, approved on June 11,
                           2010).

                           As requested by MPWT, RAMP-II will continue support for strengthening capacity of
                           Environmental and Social Office (ESO) to ensure effective implementation of safeguards to
                           mitigate potential negative impacts at all stages (planning, pre-construction, construction,
                           operation). With the limited number and frequent turnover of staff, a more holistic capacity
                           development program will be developed under RAMP-II by ESO/MPWT, with the support from
                           the World Bank and consultants, and implemented based on practical experience from the original
                           program and similar road maintenance projects in neighboring countries such as Laos and
                           Vietnam.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           During the environmental and social screening, the MPWT conducted consultations with Project
                           Affected Households (PAHs) and local communities along the two NRs through free, prior and
                           informed to establish their broad support for the project implementation. Outcomes of the
                           screening process documented in the report were reviewed and found adequate by the Bank’s
                           Safeguard Specialists. Furthermore, in preparation and endorsement of site specific EMPs and
                           ARAPs, the MPWT, with support from the safeguards consultants and the Bank safeguard
                           specialists, undertook further screening and consultation meetings with all potential PAHs in
Public Disclosure Copy




                           November 2014 and in December 2015. The PAHs and local communities visited confirmed their
                           full support for the road subproject implementation during the consultation process.

                           All safeguard instruments described above were disclosed on MPWT's website on December 23,
                           in project areas, and in the Bank’s InfoShop on December 23 and 24, 2015.. In addition, a leaflet
                           containing project information, potential impacts and mitigation measures, and grievance
                           mechanism has been prepared for distribution to all PAHs at least one month before
                           commencement of the civil works. This is to ensure that these PAHs are well-informed and
                           prepared for the civil work well in advance.
