A.2. Project Objectives
The main development objectives of the pro
posed Project are to: (i) make cost effective and 
efficient transport available for the freight and passenger traffic in the Zambezi Valley to 
accelerate economic growth in the sub
-
region; (ii) increase international traffic through the 
Beira Railway syste
m; and (iii) improve the operational, managerial and financial 
sustainability of the Beira rail system.
A.3. Project Description
GOM intends to award a 25 year concession of the Beira Railway System to the private 
sector. The concessionaire will have 
the responsibility for: (a) rehabilitation, maintenance, 
and operation of the Sena line to the town of Tete in the northwestern region of the country, 
including spur lines to the Moatize coal mines and to the border with Malawi  (totaling about 
600 km) and
 (b) realignment, maintenance and operation of the Machipanda line all the way 
to the border with Zimbabwe (about 300 km).   
The Machipanda line has adequate traffic and requires relatively little investment to continue 
operating profitably. However, the
 Sena line requires extensive rehabilitation, and although 
the estimated economic benefits are substantial, the relatively slow growth of traffic does not 
make the line commercially viable without a high share of public sector financial support. 
The projec
t will support rehabilitation of the Sena rail line to a standard that will carry all of 
the traffic on
-
offer and more, including coal produced by the current deep
-
mining 
technology.

The project consists of two components:
Component 1.
Improvement of th
e Beira Railway System. 
This component 
comprises rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of the Beira railway system under a 
concession agreement with the private sector.   IDA funds will be used exclusively to finance 
part or all of the expenditures rel
ated to the rehabilitation of the Sena line and its spur lines, 
totaling 600 km, including the cost of environmental and social enhancement measures. 
Component 2.
Institutional Strengthening. 
This component comprises technical 
assistance and consultant se
rvices to enhance the capacity of CFM to manage 
implementation of the project and its restructured functions, supervise the construction and 
rehabilitation works, conduct independent technical and financial audit, and assist CFM in 
preparation of its long 
term railway and ports development plans.
The total  project cost is $185.0 million, of which the cost for improving the Beira Railway 
system (infrastructure rehabilitation and procurement of locomotives and rolling stock) as 
estimated by the concessionai
re is US$175.2 million (including VAT).  Of this, the estimated 
cost for the  rehabilitation of Sena line is US$106 million and realignment of the 
Machipanda line is US$10 million.  The realignment of the Machipanda line as well as 
provision of locomotives
 and wagons for both the lines will be the sole responsibility of the 
concessionaire.   However, for the rehabilitation of the Sena Line, the concessionaire is 
entitled to financial support as per the successful bid.  The proposed  Credit will support 
reha
bilitation of the Sena railway line in accordance with the terms of the concession 
agreement. The estimated cost of institutional strengthening and capacity building is $9.8 
million, of which IDA will finance about $9.0 million net of taxes.  
The total p
roject cost is estimated at US$185.0 million, of which IDA will support US$115.0 
million.

:
The Beira Railwa
ys System. 
The Beira rail system comprises two rail lines: (a) a 317
-
km 
Machipanda line linking the port of Beira to the railway network in Zimbabwe; and (b) a 
Page  3
600
-
km Sena line linking the port of Beira to the Moatize coal fields with a small spur 
linking 
the system to the rail network in Malawi.  The two lines take off from Beira and 
bifurcate at Dondo, a station about 28 kms. from Beira.  The Machipanda line goes in the 
Westerly direction up to the border station of Machipanda, where it links to the Zimba
bwe 
rail network at Mutare station.  The Machipanda line is heavily graded which c onsequently 
limits the train load.  The Sena line takes off from the Machipanda line at Dondo and goes in 
a North, North
-
Westerly direction, crossing the Zambezi river betwe
en Sena and Dona Ana 
(298 Km from Dondo).  The line again bifurcates at Dona Ana, a 254 Km line runs on the 
North bank of the Zambezi river to the Moatize terminal station and a short 44 km line runs 
North to Vila Nova Frontiera where it links up with the 
Malawi railway system.  There is, in 
addition, an 88
-
Km branch line running due East from Inhamitinga to Marromeu on the 
South bank of the Zambezi.  The line is graded in parts, particularly, for the first 36 
kilometers while starting from Moatize.
The EA
 report identified that people along the Sena Line and possibly a few people along the 
Machpanda Line need to be resettled and other people need to move their crops away from 
the railway and need to be provided with replacement land.  Around 30 houses on t
he Sena 
Line and a few houses likely on the Machipanda Line need to be moved outside the 10 meter 
limit.  In the villages the Right of Way (ROW) has been chosen to be 10 meter on each side 
of the rail and in the rural areas this is 50 meter, which is confo
rm the Mozambican law.  A 
RAP is under preparation for the project affected people.  Any future resettlement would 
follow the guidelines identified and agreed in the RAP.

Comments: 
The S
ena line was operational until 1983. Under the proposed project, the line is 
only being rehabilitated and no additional line is being built.  The rehabilitation work 
involves changing the rails and sleepers and establishing signaling and communication 
equi
pment.  No major earthwork is being undertaken and there is no cutting of or filling of 
land.  In the RPRP (Rail and Port Restructuring Project which is ongoing) two main 
environmental issues were identified which have now been addressed.  The first pertai
ned to 
the use of wooden sleepers, which would have affected the forests.  A decision has been 
taken to use only concrete sleepers except at a very few locations where non
-
standard 
sleepers need to be used.  The second pertained to de
-
mining along the rail
way line, which 
has since been addressed.  
However, since the assessment was made a few years ago, the report was updated through a 
supplemental study.  A study was conducted to formulate an Environmental Audit 
Management Plan, focused on: (i) establishi
ng environmental base line conditions and 
examining the present institutional and legal framework; (ii) assessing the physical, 
biological and socio
-
cultural environment; (iii) formulating an Environmental Audit and 
Management Plan which encompasses enviro
nmental mitigation, and monitoring, 
contingency plans, emergency response plans and health and safety plans; and (iv) 
evaluating the institutional issues relevant to establishing a well functioning rail operation 
from an environmental point of view and rec
ommending improvements and institutional 
changes as needed.  The study also reviewed the Mozambique Railways Act and addresses 
the environmental management obligations of the concessionaire during construction and 
operation of the railway line.

 Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management 
D. Summary of Key Safeg
uard 
Issues
. 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The social issues of staff retrenchment consequent to concession
ing are being addressed 
under RPRP.  A total of 10,441 staff have been retrenched so far.  Retrenchment of 
additional about 3,100 staff has been initiated and would be completed by September 
2004.  After all the concessions have been operational and the ne
cessary staff transferred, 
CFM will be left with about 500 core staff.    
The Environmental Audit and Management Plan (EA) revealed that about 30 houses and 
some small farming plots will have to be relocated along the Sena line.  The Resettlement 
Action 
Plan (RAP) to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts is currently under 
preparation, consistent with OP 4.12..  The EA and RAP would be disclosed in country 
and in the infoshop upon completion prior to appraisal.
The rehabilitation of the Sena railway
 line has very limited environmental impacts, which 
have been addressed in the Environmental Audit and Management Plan. The 
environmental impacts of the operational phase of the Sena line is indicated below.
The Sena railway line has not been used since 1
984. The rehabilitation of the railway line 
will improve access to areas which have not been easily accessible during the last 20 
years. The increased access might potentially increase illegal exploitation of sensitive 
natural resources. The concessionaire
 will be obliged to enforce existing Mozambican 
laws to ban transport of illegal forest and wildlife products on the trains.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area.
None
D.
3. Describe the treatment of alternatives 
(if relevant)
N/A
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower 
to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Under the RPRP a comprehens
ive safety, health and environment (SHE) policy is being 
developed. Within CFM an Inspectorate will be established, which will be responsible for 
oversight with regard to environmental, health and safety issues. The CFM staff of this 
Inspectorate will be t
rained to bring them on an acceptable technical level to be able to 
carry out their mandate. 
Page  6
The limited resettlement and land acquisition issues along the Sena and Machipanda lines 
will be addressed in agreement with the World Bank Safeguard Policy on I
nvoluntary 
Resettlement.
The social issues of staff retrenchment consequent to concessioning are being addressed 
satisfactorily under the on
-
going RPRP.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on sa
feguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Public consultation has been carried during the preparation of the Environmental Audit 
and Management Plan (EA) with the local population, local NGO's and local and central 
government. A R
AP is at present under preparation. Disclosure of the EA and the RAP 
will be done in
-
country in Maputo and along the railway and in the InfoShop prior to 
appraisal.
