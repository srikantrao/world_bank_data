    B. Project Development Objective(s)
    The objective of the project is to provide key strategic support to strengthen governance, the legislative
    framework, and community engagement in the mining sector in the Solomon Islands
    C. Project Description


    D. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
    (if known)
    SIMGov will provide only TA and there are neither physical investments that will be funded by the
    project nor any specific physical investments that will be proposed or appraised by the TA. Although
    none of the project activities are expected to have any physical impact on the ground, given the nature of
    the advisory work to be provided it is anticipated that down-stream impacts will be created which would
    be reasonably attributable to this work, according the project is proposed to be B rated.
    E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
    The Government has been a recipient of IDA-funded and Trust Funded support for many years and its
    institutional capacity for safeguard management has been under rapid development. Notwithstanding
    progress, the capacity for the management of sensitive issues in the resources sector are very low and
    meaningful support will be required throughout the proposed operation.
