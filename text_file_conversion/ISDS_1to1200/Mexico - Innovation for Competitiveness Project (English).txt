A.2. Project Objectives 
 
Mexico’s 2001-
2006 National Development Plan outlines a “Vision of Mexico in 2025.”  
A
component of that vision is quoted by the CPS as follows:  
“It will be a dynamic 
nation, with leadership in the world, with a stable and competitive growth
and with an 
all-inclusive development process in harmony with the environment.”
 
The program will 
contribute to the borrower’s vision and higher level objectives (as stated in the National 
Development Plan) of “increasing and expanding the country competitiveness,” and 
“improving levels of education and well being,” with its interventions that will strengthen 
the national innovation system, improve total factor productivity, and ultimately impact 
on growth.  The Government of Mexico envisions the national innovation system 
evolving to a “dynamic networked system” with increased internationalization, with 
multiple public-private partnerships, national and foreign, and with a particular focus 
towards strengthening Mexico position in NAFTA.   
 
The Program seeks to support the Government’s efforts to improve the competitiveness 
of the Mexican economy by strengthening the innovative capacity of the private sector, 
accelerating advanced human capital formation, and increasing the international 
integration of the innovation system. 
Page  2
To achieve the program’s development objectives, a first phase operation is proposed 
with two major lines of investment, in addition to supporting the policy framework for 
and internationalization of Mexico’s innovation system. First, on the
 demand side
,
the 
program would increase support to business innovation; while, second, on the 
supply side
 
the program would accelerate the formation of human capital (through strategic and 
coordinated use of the scholarship fund); and finally it would support the cohesion and 
effectiveness of Mexico’s S,T& I system.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed duration of the program is ten years divided into an initial four-year phase 
and two subsequent three-year phases.   
 
·
The first phase (2006-2009)
would help consolidate ongoing S&T sector reforms 
by strengthening business innovation and human capital development programs 
and building a strong system-wide policy and M&E system.  In addition, 
evaluations and studies will be carried out, which will help identify areas of 
further investment in the following program phases.   
 
·
The second phase (2010-2012)
would address the next steps in the building of a 
coherent innovation system, including: (i) further scaling-up of programs 
(particularly technology development and venture capital programs); (ii) building 
on the first phase’s proposed internationalization policies, by financing activities 
that strengthen the integration of the Mexican innovation into the global 
innovation system; (iii) enlarging the focus and sphere of the collaborative R&D 
networks funded in phase 1 in order to establish regional innovation clusters, and 
(iv) strengthening state-level innovation sub-systems, possibly piloting 
decentralized lending for S,T&I.   
 
·
The third phase (2013-2015)
would emphasize the consolidation of funding 
mechanisms and incentives for the National Innovation System (across all areas 
and levels of government), with increased decentralization and therefore increased 
importance of the roles played by the state-level economic development agencies 
and science and technology councils. 
 
The first phase of the program would have two main investment components: (i) 
CONACYT Program to Promote Business Innovation, and (ii) CONACYT Program to 
Finance Scholarships for Excellence and Relevance; and a smaller capacity building 
component: (iii) Support for Policies to enhance Innovation and Internationalization. 
 
Component 1:  CONACYT Program to Promote Business Innovation. 
The first component, CONACYT Program to Promote Business Innovation, would 
support the following of CONACYT’s competitive funding lines:  (A) Consortia and 
Page  3
Research Networks;  (B) Venture Capital Fund;  (C) Pre-competitive Fund; (D) Sectoral 
Fund for Economic Development (managed by the Ministry of Economy), and (E) 
Researchers and Technologists in Industry.  These funds would support established and 
start-up companies and public research centers integrating consortia, according to the 
operational guidelines for each fund.  Subprojects would be funded on the basis of project 
proposals selected under the following competitive lines, and transfers would be made on 
the basis of signed grant agreements and implementation progress. 
 
(A)  Consortia and Research Networks
:
the government strategy stresses the importance of the 
establishment of medium to long term agreements for collaborative R&D between public institutions and 
enterprises as a general mechanism to stimulate the National Innovation System.  This subcomponent 
would increase support to linkages between groups of enterprises with existing R&D absorption capacity, 
and public R&D centers. Consortia and Research Networks would operate within the framework of 
strategic areas defined in the government strategy: information and communication technologies, 
biotechnology, material sciences, industrial design and manufacturing processes, infrastructure, and urban 
and rural development.  Priority would be given to Consortia with international participation in order to 
advance the internationalization of the Mexican innovation system. This subcomponent builds on 
CONACYT’s pilot experiences from the formation of consortia in medical information technology and 
manufacturing of electrical transformers, where research is carried out both, within companies and at the 
public research centers.  Companies cover 50% of total project costs with their own resources,  the other 
50% being transferred from CONACYT to the public centers. 
 
(B) Venture Capital Fund:
(
Emprendedores
): this program for technology based start-up companies is 
being piloted under the current Knowledge and Innovation Project, and was designed with light 
bureaucratic requirements where the private entrepreneur assumes most of the risks.  CONACYT partially 
funds a trust fund established with NAFIN (A Mexican development bank), and provides technological 
evaluation of start-ups requesting financing.  NAFIN administers the fund and convenes private sector 
investors (e.g. angel investors, private venture capital firms) to leverage public funds.  Five companies are 
being funded during the pilot stage. 
 
(C)  Pre-Competitive Fund
:
also started during the current Knowledge and Innovation Project, the objective 
of this program known as 
Ultima Milla 
(Last Mile) is to help transform scientific and technological 
developments into viable high value products and services, bridging the gap between proof-of-concept and 
commercialization.  Types of activities supported by Pre-competitive Fund include prototype development, 
marketing studies and patent processing.  Proposals for funding are evaluated on a competitive basis and 
come from companies and researchers in public institutions. 
 
(D)  Sectoral Fund for Economic Development
:
this Fund is co-financed by CONACYT and the Ministry 
of Economy, and administered by the latter with technical evaluations and supervision carried out by 
CONACYT.  The Fund provides matching grants targeted to SMEs, with larger companies being able to 
participate, provided they include SMEs in their proposals.  Demand has steadily risen during the three 
funding rounds already completed, exceeding available resources by a factor of eight.  Enterprises cover at 
least 50% of total project costs.  This fund was inspired by a similar fund under the on-going KIP project.  
 
(E)  Researchers and Technologists in Industry
:
this is a labor market insertion program, with the dual 
purpose of strengthening innovative capacity within firms, and creating linkages between the universities 
and private R&D sector through the “transfer” of advanced human resources. Program participants would 
include recent doctoral and masters graduates (i.e. beneficiaries of the scholarship program) co-financed in 
decreasing proportion to work within companies. 
 
Component 2: CONACYT Program to Finance Scholarships for Excellence and Relevance. 
 
The second component, CONACYT Program to Finance Scholarships for Excellence and 
Page  4
Relevance, would support CONACYT’s scholarship programs, to increase both quality 
and relevance of human resources to society.  In Mexico the availability of advanced 
S&T skills is low, and an improved supply of such skills pared with well targeted 
incentives would lead to improved innovative capacity.  The scholarship program would 
support graduate studies at the doctoral, master and specialization levels, in accredited 
national programs and foreign programs in centers of excellence.   
 
This component’s activities would support the on-going reform of the scholarship program that seeks to 
better link supply of skills with demand from society, notably the private sector. Scholarships would be 
better targeted towards graduate programs of high relevance and excellent quality to improve Mexico’s 
S&T skill base.  Therefore, scholarships would be demand driven, in the sense that they are increasingly 
allocated to students that participate in projects meeting the needs of states (implemented through the S&T 
funds jointly administered by CONACYT and the individual states of Mexico, the so-called 
Fondos 
Mixtos
); the needs of sectors, like health and environment (through the S&T funds jointly administered by 
CONACYT and the federal line ministries, the so-called 
Fondos Sectoriales
); and the needs of the private 
sector (through the Sectoral Fund with the Ministry of Economy, collaborative R&D projects and 
researchers and technologists in industry program). 
 
The component would build on ongoing reforms, which are supported by the Knowledge and Innovation 
Project, and the evaluations of graduate programs under the policy component (component 3).  Further, it 
would prioritize the funding of scholarship towards international programs in order to utilize the 
scholarship program (and the students) as strategic human “knowledge bridges” between top foreign and 
national R&D institutions.  Component 3 would support this component with actions geared towards the 
strengthening of the national graduate programs, not only assuring that all national programs are accredited 
under current national procedures, but also facilitating international accreditation for the best programs and 
promoting linkages with relevant foreign graduate programs. 
 
Component 3:  Support for Policies to Enhance Innovation and Internationalization in Mexico. 
 
The third component, Support for Policies to enhance Innovation and 
I
nternationalization, would improve the innovation system by strengthening Mexico’s 
S,T&I policy framework, and increasing international integration. Further the component 
would support professional international exchange with strategic partners, and analytical 
work in order to raise awareness, share knowledge and experiences and promote learning 
for continuous improvement of CONACYT’s programs and Mexico’s innovation system.  
Activities under this component would therefore be of capacity building nature, and are 
grouped as follows: (A) Governance and Policy Development; (B) Support for Business 
Innovation Policies; (C) Support for Scholarship Policies; (D) Promotion and Diffusion 
Activities; and (E) Project Implementation Unit. 
 
(A) Governance and Policy Development:
supporting policy background work and the 
consolidation of an OECD standard level national M&E system, which would provide 
feedback to the governing bodies, helping create policy development cycles.    More 
specifically it would support performance evaluation of components 1 and 2, and include 
annual stakeholder workshops in order to solicit feed-back for improvement of program 
performance.  Also, support for the reform process through the institutional strengthening 
of the S,T&I governing bodies, established by the new S&T Law, is included. 
 
(B) Support for Business Innovation Policies:
including the review of the rules for 
Page  5
intellectual property rights for public-private collaborative R&D and establish actions to 
bring IPR in Mexico up to international standard. 
 
(C) Support for Scholarship Policies:
including actions for increased internationalization 
of the graduate programs, international accreditation of the best graduate programs, and a 
tracking system for graduates. 
 
(D) Promotion and Diffusion Activities:
to assure enough outreach to potential 
beneficiaries, particularly those outside the Federal District. 
 
(E) Project Implementation Unit
:
will cover staff salaries and associated expenses of the 
implementation unit.
