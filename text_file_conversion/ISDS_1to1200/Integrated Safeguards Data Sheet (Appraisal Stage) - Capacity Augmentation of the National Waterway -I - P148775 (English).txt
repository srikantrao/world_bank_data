                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The National Waterway 1 or NW1 passes through the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and
                         West Bengal, and is located between Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh) to Haldia (West Bengal) on a

                         1,620km stretch on the Ganga (between Allahabad to Farakka), on the Bhagirathi (between Farakka
                         to Jangipur) and on the Hooghly (downstream of Jangipur) river system. While the Ganga and the
                         Hoogly are natural rivers, the Bhagirathi is a regulated river primarily influenced by the barrages at
                         Farakka and Jangipur. The Feeder Canal and the navigation lock at Farakka become the link between
                         the Bhagirathi and the Ganga upstream of the barrage.

                         The notified waterway includes the whole flow zones of the rivers; but navigation channels are
                         narrower (does not and need not use the entire width of the river), and best navigation width at any
                         stretch is defined by the IWAI (and used by the operators based on navigation aid provided by
                         IWAI). The Allahabad-Varanasi stretch (237km) of the river Ganga has low flow condition except in
                         the monsoon, and it is difficult to maintain least available depth (LAD) of more than 1.2 m. The
                         Varanasi-Patna (363km) and the Patna-Farakka (460km) stretches include several braided portion of
                         the river, and substantial regular dredging is carried out each year to maintain 1.8 to 2m of LAD. The
                         Farakka-Tribeni stretch (364km) has river erosion and shoal issues, and requires bandalling and
                         regular dredging to maintain a 2.5m LAD, except that in the Bhagirathi river stretch due to the
                         controlled discharge from the Farakka Barrage and due to the river conservancy work a navigable
                         depth of at least 2m is maintained throughout the year. The Tribeni-Haldia stretch (196km) is tide
                         dominated, and a 3m LAD is usually maintained by the natural tidal processes. Overall, however,
                         maintenance of navigational channels in all the stretches is a complex task, due to large variation in
                         discharge (where peak flows are very large, and low flows very low), unstable morphological

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              A large meandering river system such as the Ganga is highly complex dynamic ecosystem due to
                              its high levels of sediment transport. The river has large water level fluctuation and unreliable
                              water depths; leading to unavailability of adequate depth suitable for navigation. The high silt

                              loads (estimated 700 million tonnes at Farraka close to India-Bangladesh border) which lead to
                              shoal formation, and in many cases cause splitting of main channel. Addressing these challenges,
                              would usually require structural measures within the water body, and if these are not designed
                              well, could have environmental and ecological implications. River training works and dredging
                              have the risk of eliminating habitats, and natural composition of ecological communities. In
                              addition navigation can also have other impacts on the water environment, such as pollution. The
                              maintenance of navigational channels in all the stretches is a complex task, due to large variation
                              in discharge (where peak flows are very large, and low flows very low), unstable morphological
                              condition of bank and bed, heavy sediment load, continuous braiding and meandering of the river.
                              Due to the complexity of investment and operations, geographical extent and ecological richness
                              of the project areas, the project financed investments, unless carefully designed, could potentially
                              lead to significant impacts on the river system as well as site-specific impacts, and changes in
                              sediment flow of the river. Based on such initial assessment of risks, Environmental Assessment
                              of the project set out to avoid (as far as possible) these potential environmental impacts and risks;
                              and manage and mitigate the residual potential impacts and risks. As a result of the Environmental
                              Assessment, and subsequent incorporation in plans and designs for the project has reduced the
                              risks (by avoiding specific interventions, such as dredging in the critical stretches of protected
                              areas; or by minimizing the interventions). Consequently, there is no potential large scale,
                              significant and/or irreversible impacts from the project. The plan for mitigating and managing the
                              residual risks are reasonable and implementable. In addition, the project is aiming at very

                           The investments in facilities will have limited adverse impact on livelihood and lead to
                           displacement of people affected by land acquisition. Based on the risks associated with loss of
                           livelihood of close to 233 household at Sahibganj, social impact assessment was carried out to
                           identify the scale of impact at household level. The Resettlement action Plan clearly lays down
                           appropriate mitigation plan including the relocation site and process of rehabilitation. The project
                           will carry out a detailed assessment in the first year of project implementation on the likely impact
                           on fisher folk who may be impacted by increase in number and frequency of vessel movement.
                           Overall, the adverse impacts are not significant.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           The surrounding of the project (i.e., either banks of the river Ganga) is densely populated, with
                           some 67 cities and large towns located on the Banks of the river. Consequently, the transport
                           network is also dense, albeit the capacities are not sufficient to cater to the expected rise in traffic -
                           both passenger and goods in the short and medium term. The World Bank has financed capacity
                           augmentation national highways parallel to the river, and a large number projects improving the
                           state highways and rural roads (especially in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar); and is currently financing
                           the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor Project (aimed at improving the capacity and efficiency of
                           goods movement by rail) which is also parallel to the waterway. In addition to the World Bank
                           financed projects, a larger number of road and rail improvement or capacity augmentation projects
                           were also implemented in last 10 years, and further larger number of such projects are being
                           implemented and planned. Owing to this improvement in transport network, the pace of

                           urbanization and industrialization has increased in the recent years, and in future, such urban-
                           industrialization and consequent land use changes are expected to be rapid. Overall, the nature of
                           agrarian economy in the districts abutting the river is changing in favor of more manufacturing and
                           service industry driven economy. It could be noted that the rapid urban-industrialization (and
                           associated land use changes) are happening irrespective of river transport.

                           During operation of the project, it is expected that further improvement to navigational reliability
                           and safety will induce increased river traffic; and may induce similar improvement in river
                           transport in tributaries and distributaries of the Ganga, which in turn may induce urbanization of
                           the additional multi-modal transport nodes. Although the project mainly aims at goods traffic, in
                           future the demand for passenger transport including tourist transport will also increase. On the
                           beneficial side, the medium and long term impacts will involve additional livelihood and
                           employment opportunities, not only from the river transport, but also from the induced urban-
                           industrialization. The benefits will also include further additional reduction of GHG emission. On
                           the negative side, there would be increased risks of wastewater generation, ballast waters, and oil
                           spills - with associated impacts to aquatic species and on the livelihood of the fisherpersons. With
                           increased traffic, especially induced in tributaries with narrower flow zones, the risks of bank
                           erosion from wave actions caused by vessels would be there, as well as capital and maintenance
                           dredging in those tributaries might change the dynamic river morphology and associated decrease
                           in abundance and diversity of benthic and aquatic communities. In the project area (which does


                                                                       Page 9 of 14
                           not include the tributaries), such risks are limited. The risks are also further limited due to the
                           operation of the Namami Gange Program (National Program for Clean Ganga, partly financed by
                           the World Bank NGRBA Project), which aims to clean up the Ganga, avoid any further pollution

                           load, and aims at restoring the natural flow and quality of the River. This project, and all other
                           projects - current or upcoming - need to conform with aims of the Namami Gange Program, and
                           therefore will need to comply with strict pollution control regime.

                           In the long term, the currently envisaged multi-modal terminals and repair facilities may need
                           expansion. It could be anticipated that more terminals will come up, even in the medium term.
                           These will have the potential to change the local land uses. However, given that the both banks of
                           river Ganga is already densely populated, that there is no significant large continuous stretches of
                           natural forests or protected terrestrial areas, and that sufficient number of cities, towns, and large
                           villages are located on both banks (where these terminals could be located), the chances of
                           destruction of these natural forests or wetlands or protected areas are low. It is highly likely that
                           the land use changes will be about agricultural areas or fallow lands converted to commercial
                           transport infrastructure land uses.

                           As part of the cumulative impact assessment, to understand the impacts of a large program of
                           investments, additional actions over and above those described in the ESIA and EMPs were
                           recommended. These include GRIHA energy-efficiency standards for design and construction of
                           terminals; appropriate waste management standards for terminals and vessels, state of the art river
                           information system, health and safety standards for operations; siting for multimodal terminals as
                           to reduce congestion and pollution impacts in cities; integrating passenger services and tourism;
                           greenhouse gas emissions accounting for construction and maintenance of NW1. These
                           recommended improvements to the standards of construction and operation of NW1 would ensure
                           impacts over the longer term are minimized, and operations are more sustainable.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.

                           The EA included an analysis of alternatives of the proposed development options based on three
                           aspects, strategic (with or without project), planning (location, tree cutting, proximity to critical
                           environmental resources, and connectivity) and technology considerations. Overall, the Ã¢
                           ➂❨➂ With Project' Scenario is considered the better option as it will (i) improve the freight
                           transportation efficiency, thereby reducing environmental impacts, (ii) substantially reduce the
                           GHG emissions, in part fulfilling India's Nationally Determined Commitments by 2030; (iii)
                           reduce fuel requirements, and transport of large quantity of fuel from distant ports, saving
                           emissions and pollution; and (iv) improve the socio economic conditions. With the already
                           saturated rail and road networks, inland navigation will reduce pressure on land acquisition
                           (especially in the case of agriculture and forest land), and tree cutting for expanding other modes
                           of transport. With respect to planning of facilities such as terminals, and the navigation channel
                           within the river flow zone, all possible locations upstream and downstream on either banks were
                           studied, and sites and channel that avoids most of the local environmental issues were selected.
                           Additionally, the operational requirements including avoidance of barrage, speed of vessel, etc.,
                           were modified to minimize impacts on protected aquatic areas. On the technology side,
                           alternatives were studied, and best technology choices were made, such as low-draft vessels to
                           avoid dredging, intended switch to compressed natural gas as fuel for the vessels, zero discharge
                           and green buildings for all terminals and repair facilities, the highest health and safety standards
                           for operation of terminal facilities and navigation operations clean and efficient vessel fleet, and
                           state of art river information systems - all aimed to minimize environmental, health and safety

                           minimizing impacts, there will be residual anticipated impacts on ecological and aquatic
                           environment, but these are low to moderate and manageable with implementation of the

                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The Borrowers prepared (i) a cumulative impact analysis (CIA) report which includes a study on
                           the critical environmental resources to provide guidelines to avoid impacts on these as possible,
                           and recommends measures to manage direct, indirect and induced impacts; (ii) a consolidated
                           environmental impact assessment (EIA) report including an overall plan for avoiding, mitigating
                           and managing environmental, health and safety impacts; and (iii) stand-alone environmental
                           assessment including environment management plans, suitable to be incorporated in the contracts
                           for design-build-operate contracts of all major interventions planned in the project. The
                           consolidated EA was not limited individual sub-projects, rather it addressed environmental
                           impacts of investment sectors taken together based on two categories (a) impacts associated with
                           barge and dredging operations and (b) impacts associated with civil interventions. To supplement
                           this consolidated EA, detailed EAs and management plans have been prepared for the construction
                           and operation of all investment categories (construction and operation); and site specific EMPs
                           have been prepared for known works prior to appraisal. These include (i) dredging requirements,
                           (ii) barge operations, (iii) navigation lock at farraka, and (iv) multi-modal terminals at Sahibganj,
                           Varanasi and Haldia. The Borrowers also prepared a Social Assessment (SIA) Report, and
                           Resettlement Action Plans (RAP).

                           The EIA provides for the management of social and environmental risks and impact mitigations
                           for works. Specifically it includes (a) analysis of alternatives based on locations, design, proximity
                           to markets and transport modes and technology selection (b) impact of project interventions on air
                           quality, noise, water quality, sediment transport, aquatic habitats and avifauna and riverbanks, and
                           (c) environmental management plan for various categories of infrastructure for management of

                           environmental impacts. Environmental impacts and requisite safeguard documentation for (i)
                           installing navigation aids, (ii) construction of Ro-Ro jetties, (iii) low draft fleet optimization and
                           (iv) barge maintenance facilities will be assessed in detail once the exact location and scope of
                           specific activities have been identified during project implementation.

                           The IWAI including its regional offices, although not familiar with the Bank safeguards policies,
                           are implementing projects within the national and state environmental policy and legal
                           frameworks, which are, in many cases, close to the Bank Safeguard Policies. The Government of
                           India (the borrower) has a number of institutions dealing with social and environmental
                           safeguards, albeit with mixed records of implementation and enforcement. Usually, a project of
                           this scale and magnitude goes through a process of environmental due diligence. However, inland
                           navigation is exempt from the requirements under the EIA Notifications, and unless there are
                           massive civil construction works, this project will not require mandatory EIA clearance from the
                           Government of India (even if at the state level, there will be need for specific approval from
                           regulatory institutions with respect to Water Act, Hazardous Material (Transport, Handling and
                           Storage) Notification, etc.). IWAI is already attempting to develop and implement standards for
                           occupational health, safety and pollution management, akin to applicable national and
                           international standards. However, IWAI itself will need to augment its capacity so as to be able to
                           implement the standards among all potential future (private sector) operators on the NW1.

                           To initiate the capacity building for management of environmental and social issues in the project,
                           IWAI (the implementing agency) has already designated a few staff (albeit with turnover issues) at
                           the project management unit (PMU). The regional field offices will have social specialists to

                           for the IWAI at the HQ and its regional/field offices, which would then by duly to be
                           implemented by the project. Project staff will be trained in the planning and implementation of the
                           environmental and social management plans and frameworks. Further, the curricula of the national
                           level training institute(s) are being revamped to incorporate HSE issues, and augmentation of such
                           capacity building initiative (targeting the future cadre of operators) are part of the Institutional

                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The EA and SA reports were prepared in very substantial consultation with stakeholders, to ensure
                           the environmental and social assessment, and other safeguard requirements be carried out in
                           compliance with the social and environmental policies and procedures as specified by the
                           Government of India and the World Bank Group safeguard policies. The draft EA documents (the

                           Comments: The investments in facilities will have limited adverse impact on livelihood and lead
                                         to displacement of people affected by land acquisition. Based on the risks associated
                                         with loss of livelihood of close to 233 household at Sahibganj, social impact
                                         assessment was carried out to identify the scale of impact at household level. The
                                         Resettlement action Plan clearly lays down appropriate mitigation plan including the
                                         relocation site and process of rehabilitation. The project will carry out a detailed
                                         assessment in the first year of project implementation on the likely impact on fisher
                                         folk who may be impacted by increase in number and frequency of vessel movement.
