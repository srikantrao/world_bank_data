            Himalayan University Consortium Grant (P155851)



    The development objective of this project is to build a sustainable partnership of research institutions in the Hindu
    Kush Himalayan region working on issues of significance to regional water resources management.

 3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The existing components of the HUC Grant are largely completed. The grant will be strengthened by adding an
additional component to provide a secretariat for research coordination on the Indus Basin, which focuses on
strengthening not only enhanced research partnerships but also the science to policy exchange, and on understanding
and assessing the impact of climate change in the Indus Basin.

    4. PROJECT LOCATION AND SALIENT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS RELEVANT TO THE SAFEGUARD ANALYSIS (IF
       KNOWN)
    The Himalaya University Consortium (HUC) Grant is a South Asia Region Project with knowledge and capacity
    building activities and with no physical intervention. The proposed restructuring and additional financing will
    continue support for the ongoing activities as well as include a new component “Research coordination in
    the Indus Basin?. There is no physical activities and no TA that will lead to investment. The dedicated
    Secretariat, hosted by ICIMOD, with coordinating functions will be responsible for managing the program
    and ensuring its progress and smooth operation, and would organize the Indus Basin Knowledge Forum and
    annual meetings to enhance coordination, cooperation and cross learning. The proposed restructuring and
    additional financing will not trigger new safeguard policy and does not change safeguard Category (the
    project remains Category ‘C’ as was the original project).
