C.  Project Description  
 
The Project aims to improve quality of care and access to basic health services for poor and vulnerable 
populations in Sughd and Khatlon oblasts by upgrading selected primary health care facilities and by 
supporting organizational and financing reforms in the Tajikistan health sector to strengthen and give 
added prominence to primary and preventive health care.  Four components are envisaged: 
 
Component A.  Strengthening Policy, Planning and Management at the Ministry of Health
.
This 
component [$1.5 million] would finance three kinds of activities.  First, it would finance stage-setting 
analytical work such as National Health Accounts, a hospital costing exercise, a functional review of the 
health sector, a human resources study that covers both workforce planning and training issues, a hospital 
rationalization plan for Sughd and Khatlon oblasts, and an effort to cost the existing state guaranteed 
package of health services.  In doing so it would build the capacity of MOH staff to carry out basic 
analytical tasks in health policy and planning.  Second, it would finance local and international 
consultants to work with MOH staff to prepare a realistic but comprehensive sector strategy and sector 
expenditure framework
—drawing on the analytical work described above—and to develop an 
implementation plan and sector-wide monitoring indicators based on this strategy.  This would require 
extensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders including 
inter alia 
MOF, the President’s 
Page  2
Administration, oblast and rayon health administrators, donor agencies and NGOs.  The would be to 
develop an agreed vision of the health sector that guides government, donor and civil society efforts for a 
3-5 year period, and in turn to lay the foundation for Tajikistan to adopt a Sector-Wide Approach to the 
health sector in 2-3 years.  Third, it would finance capacity building efforts for MOH staff
—and oblast 
and rayon health administrators as appropriate—in health policy and planning and monitoring and 
evaluation.  These would be related to the organizational and financing reforms to be supported under 
Component B, e.g. annual Health Accounts updates or public expenditure tracking surveys to measure 
actual increases in the PHC budget. 
 
The end result of these activities should be improved leadership, policy-making and management 
in the health sector and a move toward a Sector-Wide Approach in health founded on
 
agreed sector 
strategy, a basic MTEF and strong government-led donor coordination.  Project supervision could from 
the outset be arranged in SWAp format, e.g. with twice-yearly “health summits” and efforts to strengthen 
donor coordination around a common reform program; this would increase the visibility of reform efforts 
and induce actors such as MOF and the President’s Administration to participate more systematically in 
health policy dialogue, neither of which has been the case to date. 
 
Component B.  Implementing Organizational and Financing Reforms in the Health Sector
.
The 
government recently embarked on a set of organizational and financing reforms in the health sector.  The 
broad direction of these reforms has been positive: they have included elements of hospital autonomy, 
basic benefit package development and efforts to strengthen primary care, all of which are appropriate 
choices for Tajikistan.  However, they have also been marked by a hurried and piecemeal approach to 
implementation and a lack of overall coherence.   
To address these issues, this component [$1.5 million] would help MOH design and implement a 
coherent—if modest—program of organizational and financing reforms.  The program would emphasize 
two things: first, giving increased prominence and independence to primary care relative to hospital 
services, both through changes in PHC financing and efforts to improve PHC management at the rayon 
level; and second, improving the fairness and transparency of payments for health services in general.  
Specific candidates for support might include scaling-up the state guaranteed package of health services, 
introducing formal co-payments in hospitals, introducing the family group practice model in primary care 
and possibly oblast-level pooling of funds for hospital services.  These are all consistent with the 
government’s policy directions and are areas where the government has taken initial steps already, e.g. 
through its decision to adopt capitation-based payments for PHC, its efforts to design and pilot a benefits 
package and its recent introduction of “paid services” to help formalize informal payments in the hospital 
sector, among others.  The component would therefore finance technical assistance, training, study tours, 
workshops, equipment and implementation support for MOH and health administrators in oblasts and 
rayons where the reform program would initially be implemented.  It would also introduce a basic 
management information system for hospitals and PHC.  
 
Component C.  Strengthening Primary Health Care in Sughd and Khatlon Regions
.
This component [$7 
million] would help rehabilitate PHC facilities and unblock bottlenecks to the delivery of PHC services in 
selected communities in Sughd and Khatlon provinces.  A hybrid of centrally-planned and demand-driven 
approach is proposed, whereby the broad selection of candidate sites is undertaken by MOH and oblast 
health administrators—based on a rationalization and investment plan being developed under the PHRD 
grant—but where the final selection of sites is based on proposals submitted by communities, health 
workers and local health officials together.  Proposals would have to account for bottlenecks to the 
delivery of PHC services in a given area, e.g. “absence of trained staff,” “lack of running water at PHC 
facility,” “no local access to drugs,” etc.  Issues such as pharmaceutical supply and the availability of 
qualified health workers would be mandatory for all proposals to address; other issues (“our health 
worker needs a bicycle”) would be left for communities themselves to raise.  Using objective criteria—
including 
inter alia
 the technical competence and realism of proposals, their consistency with the 
investment and rationalization plan, their consistency with the envisaged scope of PHC services, and the 
Page  3
level of community and health worker involvement in preparing them
—grants would be awarded for 
communities to pursue the activities outlined in their proposals.  These would fall under three headings: 
facilities rehabilitation; meeting core bottlenecks to service delivery; and meeting additional needs.   
The component would therefore finance rehabilitation works, technical assistance for proposal 
preparation, technical assistance for carrying out the rehabilitation works, technical assistance for local 
health plan implementation and a suitable system of financial controls and audits.  The component could 
also finance basic medical equipment and furniture for rehabilitated facilities, and PHC training for health 
workers in project areas.   
 
Component D. Project Implementation
.
This would finance a Project Implementation Unit consisting of a 
director, a finance officer, a procurement officer and 1-2 technical specialists as required.  To the extent 
possible, the PIU would be integrated with MOH.  A new procurement law is in preparation and is 
expected to delegate procurement responsibility to ministries’ departments of finance and administration: 
this creates an opening to build fiduciary capacity in MOH, both as an end in itself and in preparation for 
a
future SWAp.  This will be investigated during project preparation.
