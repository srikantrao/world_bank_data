                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The overall development objective is to support the introduction of the EU-SILC survey in Bosnia
                           and Herzegovina, with the goal of enhancing the relevance and timeliness of statistical data on
                           poverty and social exclusion in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as enhancing the interaction
                           between statistics producers and statistics users in these areas.
                           C. Project Description
                           Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as other countries in the Western Balkans region, are in the middle
                           of the process of alignment of their statistical systems with those of the European Union. The
                           adoption of the EU-SILC survey instrument for purposes of measurement of poverty and social
                           inclusion indicators is a key element of this process of harmonization. Among the six Western
                           Balkans countries the implementation of EU-SILC started in 2010 in FYR Macedonia, followed by
                           Montenegro and Serbia in 2013, and planned for 2017 in Albania and Kosovo.

                           A pilot EU-SILC was conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2015, as part of the IPA 2012 Multi-
                           beneficiary Programme on Statistical Cooperation. The pilot survey was financed by Eurostat, as a
                           part of this project. Statistical offices in Bosnia and Herzegovina were supported by an expert who
                           was in charge for providing technical assistance on the questionnaire, preparation of pilot survey and
                           analysis. The pilot had multiple goals, including (i) to develop a harmonized methodology for the
                           collection of statistics on Income and Living Conditions, compatible with EU-SILC legal framework

                           and practices; (ii) to lay the grounds for the launch of a full-scale survey on continuous basis in the
                           future; and (iii) to evaluate the current production system for data on income and living conditions,
                           as well as the pilot survey itself, through a production and quality report. The survey pilot also
                           involved training for all staff involved in the survey, including the interviewers and controllers, and
                           the development of a Blaise application for both, PAPI and CAPI data entry and testing during the
                           pilot survey by the Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Federal Office for Statistics and
                           Republika Srpska Institute for Statistics. The pilot was fielded to a sample of 340 households, which
                           was a sufficient size for the purposes of the pilot.

                           Until now, the implementation of the full-scale survey is stalled due to lack of funding. This grant
                           aims to provide financing for the first year of the full EU-SILC survey in the country. In particular,
                           the grant would support (i) finalizing the work on SILC methodology preparation and testing,
                           building on earlier work, and (ii) full implementation of the full cycle of the first year of the EU-
                           SILC survey, including field work, data processing and dissemination. The TFSCB grant would thus
                           ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina can “catch up” to the rest of the countries in the Western
                           Balkans, as well foster cross-country dialogue on EU-SILC related issues. Furthermore, given that
                           CAPI was adopted for the purposes of the SILC pilot in BiH, supporting the implementation of the
                           full-scale EU-SILC would allow us to support the streamlining of CAPI in BiH.

                           More generally, the grant would also support increasing capacity for statistical production, helping
                           qualified staff to undertake independently all stages in the statistical business production model and
                           to provide data users and stakeholders with evidence-based statistical results for better design of
                           socio-economic policies at all levels of the rather complicated administrative structure in BiH.
                           Specifically, data provided by EU-SILC would aid activities such as: targeting of social benefits,
                           planning of budgets, tackling discrimination (based on sex, gender, social, etc.) and, in general,
                           increasing the level of “statistical culture” in the country.
