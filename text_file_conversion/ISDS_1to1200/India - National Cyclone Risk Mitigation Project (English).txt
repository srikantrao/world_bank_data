B.  Project Objectives 
 
The overall development objectives of the project is to assist the Government of India in 
mitigating the risks and vulnerability of the people of India to natural disasters, particularly 
cyclones, in order to save lives and reduce social, economic and financial impacts in the event of 
future disasters.  In collaboration with the state governments, this is expected to be achieved 
through: i) strengthening the cyclone forecasting systems and early warning systems; ii) 
supporting cyclone risk mitigation investments; iii) enhancing the institutional and technical 
capacity of the national, state government and communities in multi-hazard mitigation, 
preparedness and response. 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
The project development objective is expected to be achieved through the following main 
components:   
 
A. 
Upgrading the cyclone forecasting, tracking and early warning and dissemination 
systems (USD 85 million)
.
This component would support activities aimed to enhance 
the capacity of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is mandated for 
cyclone forecasting and warning, to provide longer lead times in cyclone forecasts (up to 
Page  2
24 hrs from the present 12 hrs), more specific predictions of land fall points (up to district 
and sub-district level, from the present long stretches covering more districts), and timely 
dissemination of warnings in local languages (at least 24 hrs before). 
 
B. 
Cyclone risk mitigation investments in vulnerable states (USD 195 million)
.
This 
component would support activi
ties aimed to assist the government’s effort to mitigate 
cyclone risks in the 13 cyclone prone states, through the provision of financing for high-
priority cyclone risk mitigation investments (such as cyclone shelters, shelterbelts, 
mangrove plantations and coastal zone management works). These investments, to be 
identified, developed and implemented by respective states, would enhance the capacity 
of the states to withstand cyclones, introduce concepts of mitigation into development 
planning, and provide incentives to the states to focus on mitigation activities.  
 
C. 
Technical Assistance for Hazard Risk Management Capacity Building (US$ 12 million)
.
This component would support the overall strategies and current initiatives of the Indian 
government to enhance the capacity at the national and regional level to better manage 
and to mitigate the country’s natural hazard risk. Activities supported under this 
component are targeted:  a) to enhance the outreach and quality of essential training 
programs; b) to strengthen the knowledge base on the economic and social impact of 
natural hazards, and the effectiveness and efficiency of management and mitigation 
measures as a basis for prioritizing hazard risk mitigation investments at all 
administrative levels; and c) to mainstream risk mitigation elements into the urban/rural 
planning process.  National Institute of Disaster Management under MoHA would 
implement this component. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Thirteen cyclone-prone states
1
with a total population of 500 million people are expected 
to be benefited by the project. 
 
E. 
Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
In order to have a focused attention on environment and social issues and ensure that 
the project achieves its development outcomes, a Social and Environmental Management Plan 
will be prepared by the Borrower in accordance with the Bank’s O.P. 4.01, which will be 
submitted to the Bank for review and clearance prior to appraisal. The Plan will cover at least the 
following: (i) the overall outcomes that the EMP would aim to reduce social and environmental 
risks, reduce vulnerability of the poor and increasing security of livelihoods; (ii) the process of 
applying environmental and social screening and assessment of investment projects; and (iii) a 
strategy for capacity building of MoHA, state governments, other Government departments/ 
organizations, NGOs and other civil society organizations in  environmental management.
