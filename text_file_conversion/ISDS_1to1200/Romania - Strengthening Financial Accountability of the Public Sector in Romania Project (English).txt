 B. Project Objectives
 The overarching objective of this activity is to provide direct support for the implementation of the
 measures under the first FEG-DPL to strengthen the fiscal management by improving the quality of
 public spending and financial performance of the SOEs.

 C. Project Description
 The proposed activity consists of 3 components:

 Component 1: Introduction of the results-informed budgeting (RIB)
 Its rationale is for the government to be able to allocate resources more efficiently by formulating the
 budget based on performance from previous year. This gives the MoPF an efficient tool to respond to
 budget requests from the line ministries and at the same time for the latter to defend the spending
 needs by the results achieved by their programs. The activity includes the pilots of RIB in 4 line
ministries; where the process is managed and methodologically guided by the MoPF and the ministries
themselves prepare the program structure with support of MoPF and international consultants procured
under the grant. The capacity building workshops and awareness raising activities with all relevant
counterparts; technical changes to the budget classification and chart of accounts, and related IT
configuration are part of the activities under this component.

Given the present situation, where no line ministries submit their budget requests based on the results
on indicators from the previous year and the ministries use the line budget structure; the team
discussed with the MoPF counterparts the international examples of the approaches the countries have
taken to introduce RIB. The experiences of France, Sweden, Russia and South Korea show various
models of budget program structure and the size of the programs; starting positions for the reform; and
motivations. Some of the lessons that could be drawn for piloting the RIB in Romania are that it takes
time to legitimize the programs and their performance measures; the responsible ministry must
implement measures to also ensure compliance with the program structure; real value is in the use of
performance information for internal steering and sparking a conversation that may require further
investigation (evaluation); the RIB changes the relations between the budget authority and line
ministries in regards to the budget negotiations and management discussions; one should avoid any
organizational restructuring at the start when introducing the RIB; and finally, the mistake that
countries make is it to use the existing indicators (many of which are focused on the activities) and too
little program outcomes and outputs.

Component 2: Improving the quality of financial reporting (FR) of SOEs (preparation for
harmonization with IFRS) The rationale for this activity is to decrease the fiscal losses by tightening
the financial oversight of the SOEs. The promotion of good practices in financial reporting of the
SOEs (including the move towards IRFS) is part of the comprehensive reform program of the SOEs
under the FEG-DPL. According to the Memorandum on state ownership and oversight approved by
the government in April 2014, the oversight function is placed within the MoPF. While the full
harmonization with IFRS for all SOEs is beyond the timeframe of this component, the technical advice
includes a) stocktaking of the present FR standards compared to the IFRS, strategic and technical
guidance on bringing this gap, piloting the new methodology in up to 5 SOEs, with support of the
related capacity building both in these as well as the MoPF to perform the financial monitoring
function.

Component 3: Improving the wage bill management
The rationale for this activity is to implement the 2011 Unitary Pay Law by making an evidence-based
decision on the wage bill changes. This is to rectify effectively the present situation, where the
government increased the minimum wage, but kept the wage bill at the same level. The advisory and
analytical work includes the a) policy note exploring the options on decompressing the central
government wage bill; b) devising a simulation model to estimate the impact of these proposed
options; and c) making a policy proposal to improve the wage bill management based on this evidence.
