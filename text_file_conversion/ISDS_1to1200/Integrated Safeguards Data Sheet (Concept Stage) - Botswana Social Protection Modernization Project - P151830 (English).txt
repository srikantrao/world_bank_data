B. Project Objectives
The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of selected social protection programs in Botswana.
C. Project Description
The Project would support the Government's proposed modernization of its social protection system
through two interrelated components. Component 1 would finance improved efficiency and
effectiveness of social protection activities implemented through a results-based disbursements


﻿grouped in three results areas. As noted above, the Government of Botswana already makes a
significant and sustained investment in social projection programs; however, it recognizes that
systematic reform could help improve the outcomes from these interventions. The use of results
areas and disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) under Investment Project Financing (IPF) would
O
U       facilitate the Government to take specific actions linked to gains in the efficiency and effectiveness
of its social protection system.
Component 1: Improving the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Social Protection System (estimated
US$22 million) would adopt a results-based financing approach to support Government efforts to
increase the contribution of social protection in reducing poverty and inequality by improving the
efficiency of the system and effectiveness of key programs. Disbursements would be linked to
specific indicators in three results areas : (i) promoting efficiency gains by strengthening the social
protection system through the development and adoption of an objective targeting system to reach
the poorest, implementation of a social registry of beneficiaries to increase harmonization,
coordination and integration of selected programs, and development and implementation of an MIS
for key selected programs to improve monitoring and inform decision making (Results Area 1); (ii)
improving the effectiveness of the social protection system to reduce poverty and inequality by
expanding coverage of selected programs to support the poorest, and delivering rationalized
packages of benefits and additional support to an expanded number poor households (Results Area
2); and (iii) ensuring the availability of relevant and up-to-date data for implementation, monitoring,
and decision making not only of social protection programs but also on broader issues of poverty,
education, labor, and health by increasing the frequency of key national representative surveys
(Results Area 3).
Component 2: Social Protection and Labor (SPL) Technical Assistance (estimated US$8 million)
would complement achievement of the DLIs under Component 1 through technical assistance to
Government, particularly the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, as well as the
Office of the President, Statistics Botswana, and the Ministry of Labor and Home Affairs, to perform
the necessary activities to achieve the outcomes detailed in the results areas. It would use a regular
U       investment lending approach to finance technical assistance and investments in support of SPL
reforms and to conduct the MTHS field work and data dissemination.
D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
The Government's social protection system has robust, national coverage. In 2012, the country spent
approximately 4.4 percent of its GDP to social protection, including both contributory programs and
non-contributory social assistance. This level of expenditure is high relative to regional comparators
and has allowed for widespread coverage. Nearly 70 percent of the population (and 90 percent of the
poorest) benefits from at least one Government-funded social protection program. As the Project
proposes to support widespread reforms to this existing social protection system, the Project is
expected to be national in scope.
E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
Given the Borrower's limited experience implementing World Bank lending operations and
safeguard compliance, the Project design proposes a component fully devoted to technical assistance.
This assistance will include building capacity for safeguard policies. As outlined in this ISDS, the
Project is expected to trigger only the Indigenous Peoples Policy and specific support will be
provided for the development and monitoring of the required Indigenous Peoples Plan.

II. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Safeguard Policies          Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment    No          The social protection system in Botswana is
OP/BP 4.01                              primarily comprised of programs that offer
unconditional cash and/or in-kind transfers to
beneficiaries. These programs have no
environmental impact. The relatively small public
works program, Ipelegeng, only focuses on routine
maintenance (such as trimming vegetation) and
cleaning (such as litter collection) within public
spaces. Moreover, the Government fully funds the
Ipelegeng through national revenues and, therefore,
the Project financing is not expected to be allocated
to this program's operational costs. Such activities
will be done in accordance with national and local
laws and procedures.
Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04  No          The project will not affect or involve natural habitats.
Forests OP/BP 4.36          No          The project will not affect or involve forests or
forestry.
Pest Management OP 4.09     No          The project does not involve pest management.
0
Physical Cultural Resources  No          The project will not affect or involve physical
OP/BP 4.11                               cultural resources.
*       Indigenous Peoples OP/BP    Yes          As this Project targets all of Botswana, and
a       4.10                                    specifically poor and vulnerable peoples, the Project
is expected to impact the indigenous peoples of
Botswana known as the San. San have historically
been among the poorest of the poor and therefore are
often most in need of social protection program
support. As a result, the Indigenous Peoples Policy is
triggered, and the Project will prepare an Indigenous
Peoples Plan to ensure that the San are appropriately
included in any data collection, consulted, and
modifications made to social protection are inclusive
and culturally suitable for the San peoples.
Involuntary Resettlement OP/ No         The project does not involve land acquisition leading
BP 4.12                                 to involuntary resettlement and/or restrictions of
access to resources and livelihoods.
Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37   No          N/A.


﻿Projects on International     No            N/A.
Waterways OP/BP 7.50
Projects in Disputed Areas OP/ No           N/A.

III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN
A. Tentative target date for preparing the PAD Stage ISDS: 01-Oct-2015
B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
The specific studies and their timingi should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
The need for specific studies and/or additional analysis, particularly as related to the Indigenous
Peoples Policy and development of the Indigenous Peoples Plan, will be determined during the
planned September 2015 preparation mission, in which the Project's social safeguard specialist is
expected to participate. In keeping with the Bank's guidelines, the Indigenous Peoples Plan will
be finalized prior to Appraisal, which is scheduled for December 2015.
