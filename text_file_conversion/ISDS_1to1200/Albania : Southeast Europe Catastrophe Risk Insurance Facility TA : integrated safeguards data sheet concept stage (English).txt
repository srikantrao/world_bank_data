 B. Project Objectives

 The Project Objective is to help increase the access of homeowners, farmers, the enterprise sector and
 government agencies to financial protection from losses caused by climate change and geological
 hazards by enabling Europa Re, a catastrophe and weather-risk reinsurance facility, to scale up existing
    project activities and expand program operations to Bosnia and Herzegovina.


    C. Project Description
    SEE CRIF is a catastrophe and weather-risk insurance program, which enables easy access to
    innovative weather and earthquake risk insurance products for consumers in participating countries.
    The main design features of progam closely follow the previous prototypes of national and regional
    catastrophe and weather-risk programs developed with direct technical and capital assistance from the
    Bank – the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool, the Romanian Catastrophe Insurance Pool and the
    Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility. However, the program contains several innovations.
    These include (i) the development of both traditional indemnity type catastrophe insurance products
    and parametric index-based weather risk hedging contracts; (ii) private management and governance
    of the Facility; (iii) a sunset clause for the duration of government participation in the program; and
    (iv) the openness of the Facility to a wider range of clients, inclusive of households, farmers,
    government agencies and the enterprise sector exposed to weather risk.
    To implement the SEE CRIF program in Southeast Europe, three countries of the region (Albania,
    FYR of Macedonia and Serbia) established Europa Reinsurance Facility Ltd. (Europa Re), a
    specialized regional property catastrophe reinsurer. Europa Re was incorporated under Swiss Law in
    Zug, Switzerland in November 2009 and was licensed as a reinsurer in 2014 by FINMA, the Swiss
    Financial Markets Regulator.
    Under this TA project that supports the continuation of SEE CRIF program, Europa Re will be scaling
    up the ongoing project activities in the member states and expanding the offering of innovative
    catastrophe insurance products and services to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Activities will include the
    development of new insurance products, technical assistance to supervisors, risk modeling, further
    development of market infrastructure to support online sales, extension of the existing IT platform for
    new insurance partners in 4 country markets, as well the development of mass retail mechanisms
    linked to alternative distribution channels (such as mobile phone operators, international wire transfer
    services providers and utilities).
    The proposed project is a replenishment of the SEE CRIF trust fund with additional SECO funding of
    US $4.12 million. Thus far, technical assistance for the SEE CRIF program has been supported by a
    US$4.45 million grant from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) (P117069), a
    US$5.5 million grant from the GEF (P123896), and a US$0.15 million grant from GFDRR (TF12450).
    Although most of funds under the existing SECO grant has been disbursed, it has been extended till
    December 31, 2018 to accommodate the new funding. The ongoing GEF grant is scheduled to close at
    the end of 2015 with all the funds fully disbursed. 1
    In terms of country membership contributions to Europa Re, in 2008, the World Bank Group Board
    approved a DRMAP loan to Albania to finance their membership contributions to Europa Re. On
    March 3, 2011, the World Bank Group Board also approved the first phase of SEE CRIF (APL1)
    which consisted of IBRD loans to Serbia and FYR Macedonia.

  Of the previous SECO $4.45 million grant, all of the funds have been disbursed with the exception of $260k, which
was retained in a VAT reserve. On June 15, 2015, Swiss Federal Tax Authority (SFTA) informed Europa RE that
services acquired with project funds are not subject to VAT. The $260k will be released and added to the new grant
amount.
