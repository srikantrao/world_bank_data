B.  Project Objectives 
 
The project development objective is to provide a sustainable, reliable system for provision of basic urban 
services, which will achieve through two types of interventions:  
 
(a) 
Increasing access to better quality basic services for urban residents, especially the poor, in 
N’Djamena and Chad’s major secondary cities (Moundou, Sarh, Abéché and Doba); and  
(b) 
Through the provision of urban management tools to cities and relevant central ministries, 
increasing transparency and accountability of urban governance and strengthening local 
stakeholders’ capacity to participate in selecting, implementing and maintaining basic urban 
services while improving urban governance for better service delivery for the country as a whole 
 
The project outputs will include (i) improved access to basic infrastructure and services by the poor; (ii) 
enhanced community participation at the neighborhood level; (iii) improved capacity at the national, 
municipal, and local levels; and (iv) increased employment and anticipated growth in SMEs. 
 
C.  Project Description  
 
The proposed project will support priority infrastructure (water, sanitation, drainage and economic 
infrastructure) in the cities of Moundou, Sarh, Abéché, Doba, and N’Djamena. By dimensioning public 
works appropriately and using labor-intensive methods, the project will create employment opportunities 
for unskilled and semi-skilled labor and promote SMEs in construction and urban services. Finally, it will 
improve capacity at the local level to plan and manage urban services and at the central level to support 
urban development. An extensive feasibility study financed by the Bank in 1997 (report prepared by 
Page  2
Groupe Huit-BCEOM) identified the major infrastructure priorities, which were endorsed by all 
stakeholders (the Government, the Mayors and the beneficiaries). These priorities remain valid today. 
 
The project will have two components: (i) strengthening urban management capacity; and (ii) provision 
for basic urban services. 
 
Component 1: Strengthening urban management capacity (estimated cost: US$4.0 million) 
 
The lack of urban management capacity at the local level and the inability of the central level to provide 
adequate support to cities are constraints to effective provision of basic services and promotion of 
economic growth. This component aims at providing support to the key ministries, municipalities, the 
private sector and community groups, in terms of policy development, public management tools, technical 
assistance, equipment and training and focuses on: 
 
(a) 
Strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry for Land Administration, Urban 
Development and Housing (
Ministère de l’Aménagement du Territoire, de l’Urbanisme, 
et de l’Habitat
 -
MATUH); 
(b) 
Strengthening the capacities of line ministries at the municipal level to provide support 
on urban management (i.e. Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Public Works and MATUH); 
(c) 
Providing municipal management tools and training to the municipalities in order to 
improve mobilization and utilization of local financial resources; 
(d) 
Increasing the capacity in the civil society and the private sector (SMEs and consulting 
firms) to participate in local urban service delivery through technical, financial and 
management training; 
(e) 
Preparing/updating urban development plans for N’Djamena and up to12 selected cities 
(population varying between 30,000 and 60,000), namely Mongo, Kelo, Pala, Bongor, 
Bol, Mao, Am Timan, Biltine, Ati, Fada, Faya, and Léré. These development plans will 
help the cities to have a broad vision of their infrastructure needs accompanied by 
specific investment programs, and serve as a basis for seeking other donors’ financing; 
and 
(f) 
Promoting community integration and awareness for sanitation and public health, 
including HIV/AIDS. 
 
Component 2: Provision of basic urban services (estimated cost: US$ 11.0 million) 
 
This component will target service and economic infrastructure priorities in the project cities of 
Moundou, Sarh, Abéché, Doba, and N’Djamena. Priorities include: 
 
(a) 
Improving drainage, sanitation and the associated rehabilitation of affected roads; 
(b) 
Rehabilitating and extending the potable water supply system; 
(c) 
Provision of economic infrastructure (e.g. construction/rehabilitation of markets, 
slaughterhouses, depots, etc.); and 
(d) 
Provision of access roads to isolated neighborhoods.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
In January 2005, the safeguard specialists within the team are scheduled to visit the project cities, and will 
assess the national and local level capacities for safeguard policies.

The project is categorized B and the environmental and social impacts from the economic and service 
interventions will be site specific and easily mitigated. Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and 
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) are safeguards policies triggered by the project due to potential 
construction, which may have temporary environmental or social impacts. Provisions will be made in the 
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) to mitigate these impacts.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS would 
be prepared: QER review scheduled for January
 
13, 2005. 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage ISDS 
Not applicable 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The 
specific studies and their timing
1
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
The environmental assessment will be in form of an Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) and an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  An ESMF will be prepared for the cities of 
N'Djamena and Doba, since specific interventions are not known or properly defined.  An EIA will be 
prepared for Moundou, Sarh, and Abéche; as the interventions are already known. In the five project 
cities, it is very probable that planned civil works may lead to loss of land, incomes, assets, access to 
sources of livelihood etc. either temporarily or permanently.  To this end, a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) will be prepared.  During project implementation, Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) 
will be prepared by the Borrower and the individual RAPs will be reviewed and approved by ASPEN, 
then disclosed by the Borrower in the country at appropriate and accessible locations and by the Bank on 
behalf of the borrower to the InfoShop before commencement of civil works using guidelines provided in 
the RPF.  These safeguard instruments (i.e. EIA, ESMF, RPF) will be prepared in accordance to national 
environmental policies, and the World Bank environmental and social guidelines and safeguard policies. 
On completion and approval by ASPEN, these instruments will be disclosed in country and at the Bank’s 
Infoshop.
