B. Project Objectives
The Project Development Objective is to establish the key building blocks for of a basic national
safety net system and provide income support to extremely poor households in Liberia.
C. Project Description
The proposed operation will support the creation of a national safety net system, focusing on a cash
transfer program that will target extremely poor households, including those that have been affected
by the Ebola outbreak. Project coverage will be based on transparent criteria that will be agreed


﻿during project preparation. Based on the preliminary discussions with Government, regular cash
transfers will be accompanied by soft conditions (in particular nutrition and promotion of homestead
vegetable gardening). These soft conditions will provide an opportunity for poor households to
smoothen consumption and invest in the human capital of their families, particularly young children
as well as pregnant and lactating mothers.
The proposed project is expected to have the following components:
Component 1. Strengthening of the National Social Safety Net System
The objective of this component is to improve efficiency, enhance capacity and strengthen the
building blocks of a basic national social safety net system in Liberia. Specifically, this component
will finance the development of a Social Registry (SR) - a data system with information about
extremely poor households who are potential and actual beneficiaries of selected social protection
programs in Liberia. This registry will contribute to the development of an efficient SP system that
will reduce duplication, improve effectiveness of the SP sector in reaching the poorest, and unify and
streamline social protection programming in Liberia.
This component will also support the development of a Management Information System (MIS) for
the ongoing Social Cash Transfer (SCT) program to facilitate data management (at both central and
sub-national level) related to registration, benefits tracking, administration and dissemination of data.
In addition, this component will support the development of efficient payment, grievance redress,
and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems (including a randomized impact evaluation) for the
SCT program. Activities under this component will build on the progress made in developing
efficient safety net systems under the ongoing SCT REPLI program, and the Rapid Social Response
Grant for the SCT program, which supports the development of targeting tools and the design of the
SR.
Component 2: Cash Transfers
0
The objective of this component will be to provide income support to extremely poor households in
Liberia. Specifically, this component will provide regular cash transfers to at least 17,000 extremely
poor households in Liberia. The component will build on the existing SCT REPLI program, which
a      aims to provide cash transfers to at least 10,000 extremely poor and EVD affected households in
Bomi, Maryland, Grand Cape Mount, Grand Bassa, Grand Kru, Margibi, rural Montserrado and
River Gee counties. LSSN will therefore build on this program to progressively scale up
implementation throughout all 15 counties of Liberia. The transfers will be delivered to households
on a bi-monthly basis throughout the year and will vary according to the size of households. The
transfer amount under the SCT program has been calibrated to the prevailing poverty trends and food
prices and pegged at US$10-25 per month, for households with 1-5 or more members. This
component will also support the implementation of soft conditions to reinforce human capital
investments, particularly those associated with improving agricultural productivity, maternal and
child health.
Component 3. Project Management and Administration
The objective of this component is to finance program management and administration of the LSSN
project implemented by the MGCSP. The component will also strengthen coordination among safety
net programs at the national and sub-national levels. This includes equipment, vehicles, fuel, office


﻿space, and communications costs, and incremental project-related operating costs under the MGCSP
for the implementation components 1 and 2 of the project. This support will include the procurement
of service providers to implement operational aspects of the cash transfers, including data collection,
electronic registration, payments mechanisms and auditing.

D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
The project activities will have no or negligible environmental social safeguards impacts, and the
project does not involve land acquisition leading to involuntary resettlement or restrictions of access
to resources or livelihoods. There are no Indigenous Peoples in the project area.
