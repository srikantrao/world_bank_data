B.  Project Objectives  
The project’s development objective is to promote a sustainable improvement in the quality of 
life of rural communities.  Project activities will  strengthen community organization for 
governance, improve the preservation and management of natural resources and increase the 
asset base (in a broad sense) of beneficiaries and their organizations, anchored in the 
participatory assessment of needs, and planning and  management of the natural resources base 
at the microcatchment level. 
 
C.  Project Description  
The central elements of the project strategy are contained in the following project component 
outline. Micro-watershed plans would be the doorway to the implementation of the project’s on-
the-ground activities. The plans would be produced with the full involvement of the rural 
community and with flexibility for changing once participatory evaluations are carried out and 
local committees recognize the importance of changes. The Ministry of Agriculture and the 
Secretary of Environment will play major roles in project execution.

I.  Community Development and Local Institutions Strengthening
.
Includes the following 
sub-components: training, environmental education, organizational support, extension, and 
research. 
 
I.1  Training
.
Contemplates informing/sensitizing potential project beneficiaries and training 
project personnel and direct beneficiaries, including indigenous communities. 
 
Training will deal with two groups of themes: i) participatory rural diagnosis, community 
development plans, formation and functioning of groups, organization for self-governance, and 
ii) themes directly related to agricultural production, post-harvest activities (crop protection, 
production diversification, processing and marketing), and environmental issues such as soil 
management, conservation of riparian and headwater areas. 
 
I.2.  Environmental Education
.
This sub-component will boost stakeholder awareness regarding 
the need for, and commitment to, addressing national and global environmental problems to 
improve their rural livelihood. It would support educational efforts directed at helping develop an 
environmentally conscious society and would inspire personal and social responsibility for the 
environment in the rural population of the project area. Some modules could also contribute to 
improving the curriculum for rural university students to incorporate biodiversity into their 
programs.   
 
I.3.  Organizational Support
.
This sub-component will provide resources for the creation and 
operation of all categories of stakeholder bodies, since the experience of PARN in the 
establishment of local committees has been demonstrated to be very positive.  Funding will be 
provided to support day-to-day operations and meetings of community and municipal 
deliberative bodies, as community organizations and local governments will play an important 
role in the formulation of diagnostics and plans and in carrying out social monitoring. 
 
I.4.  Rural Extension
.
Rural extension will be provided to organized groups and to local 
institutions on the basis of the community and farm plans, which will be defined in a 
participatory way. 
 
It will contribute to establishing or improving confidence between beneficiaries and 
implementers, by providing information, educating decision-making bodies about the project, 
assisting the formation of organized groups, assisting beneficiaries in preparing microwatershed 
and farm plans and assessing community demands for social as well as technical and financial 
support. 
 
I.5.  Research and Studies
.
The project will finance adaptive research projects to support the 
adaptation and validation of existing land management practices and/or solutions to 
unsustainable land use issues as well as production issues identified by farming communities.  
These projects should grow out of the demands expressed by the community in the production of 
local development plans.  This sub-component will be complementary to the rural extension 
actions and the investment plans developed by the communities. 
 
Page  3
In addition, the project will finance environmental and social policy studies (Policy 
Development) to support government efforts to mainstream sustainable natural resource 
management into national rural development priorities. 
 
II.  Rural Sustainable Development Investments
.
A
Rural Investment Fund (RIF) will be 
established and will be used to encourage the adoption of the project’s microcatchments strategy.  
Building on the experience of PARN, it will provide matching grants to individual producers and 
to groups of producers.  The use of grants will  be demand-driven and based upon the MDPs.  
The details of the operation of the Fund, including eligibility criteria, etc., will be defined during 
preparation.  
 
III.  Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation
.
This component comprises three sub-
components: project administration, monitoring and evaluation, and communication and 
dissemination.  The project administration
scheme will be adapted from the experience of PARN 
based on the results of the evaluation of that project.  Monitoring and evaluation
will follow the 
norms and procedures of the World Bank and the GEF.  Finally, communication and 
dissemination
,
a
key activity, will allow for the development of proper social understanding of 
and support to the project.  The GEF will provide incremental funding to promote the replication 
of project lessons throughout other relevant areas in Paraguay.  It will also finance the exchange 
of experiences with other GEF initiatives involving the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes in 
neighboring countries. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Project actions will be targeted at the families of peasant producers and indigenous populations 
in the Eastern region, with a higher concentration of activities focused on those located in the 
departments of Concepción, San Pedro, Canindeyú, Caaguazú y Caazapá and, specifically, on 
those with the highest levels of poverty (according to the PLIPEX index). Tentatively the project 
will develop actions directly in about 110 microcatchments. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
[Guideline: Based on past experience and other available information]
 
T
he project’s objectives are both environmentally and socially sound, projecting a positive 
impact, rather than causing harm.  The PARN,  currently under implementation by the Ministry 
of Agriculture (MAG),  has an established  process for evaluation of potential negative 
environmental impacts related to specific project interventions at the microwatershed level.  The 
new proposed project will be jointly implemented by MAG and the Secretariat of Environment 
(SEMA), and as such environmental issues should receive  more attention and visibility during 
project preparation and implementation, and be better intergrated across all project components. 
In addition, the Project Team will now include staff from SEMA, which will increase the 
borrower’s capacity and willingness to properly address Safeguard Issues.  Nevertheless, 
additional training for MAG and SEMA staff on safeguard related issues will be supported under 
the project, as well as broader training on environmental issues for project stakeholders at the 
local level.  
 
Based on past experience, the Project is currently proposed as Environmental Category B
.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
 
Since the specific investments to be made under this project will not be determined until project 
preparation, it is still too early to know exactly which safeguard policies will actually be 
triggered by the project.  However, based on the experience of the PARN and other similar 
projects, it is likely that the following Safeguard Policies could be triggered:
