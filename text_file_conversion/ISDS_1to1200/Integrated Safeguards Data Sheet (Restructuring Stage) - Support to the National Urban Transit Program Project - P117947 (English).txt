Public Disclosure Copy




                         The Project is the continuation of the Integrated Mass Transit System (IMTS) Project which financed
                         the implementation of Bus Rapid Transit systems (BRTs) in six Colombian cities (BogotÃ¡-Line
                         NQS, Pereira, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, Barranquilla and Medellin-Valle de Aburra) through three
                         loans (7231-CO, 7457-CO and 7739-CO). The IMTS loan was closed on December 31, 2012. The
                         Current loan, the Colombia Support to the National Urban Transit Program Project (8380-CO), is
                         part of the Government➢❨ s broader multi-city, multi-year National Urban Transport Program
                         (NUTP) that leverages resources from the Bank, other Multilateral Development Banks (MDB) (e.g.,
                         IDB and CAF) to carry out its transformative strategy for medium- and large-sized Colombian cities.
                         The Bank project was originally designed to support six cities and their respective transit subprojects:
                         financing the implementation of BRTs in Medellin-Valle de Aburra, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, and
                         Pereira, and strategic public transport systems (SPTS) in Sincelejo and Valledupar. Cartagena and
                         Pereira were subsequently dropped from the Bank project at the client➢❨ s request, leaving four
                         cities currently being supported by the Bank. In addition, the Bank project provides technical
                         assistance (TA) for the entire government program, i.e., for all participating cities, including those
                         supported by other MDBs or through national resources. As such, the Bank➢❨ s involvement in the
                         Program through the TA component is a strategic channel that allows the Bank to stay fully involved
                         in the entire government program throughout its lifetime.

                         At almost five years since Board approval, the project has only disbursed 10.2% of net commitments.
                         While the project has achieved several critical milestones (bus systems are in operation or in early
                         operation) and all cities have demonstrated some progress, the challenges described below had - and
                         continue to have- the effect of serious delay in achieving milestones and projected disbursements.
                         Thus, overall implementation is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory and given the looming closing date
                         of end-November 2016, this rating will be downgraded to Unsatisfactory unless substantial
                         improvements are achieved, and the PDO should also likely be downgraded.

                         Nevertheless, in Medellin, Sincelejo and Valledupar, works are already underway and, for all cities,
                         all other items are undergoing bidding processes or are under design. Execution and disbursements
                         are therefore expected to pick-up (see revised disbursement projections below). The majority of
                         actions required for the technical, legal and financial restructuring of the transit systems have already
                         been completed.

                         The following is a summary of the status of each of the components, which are all underway:
                         a.       Component A - Implementing Capacity Building (US$ 15 M). This component covers
                         activities of the Coordinating Unit within the MT that are currently underway, including its
                         strengthening with 28 individual consultants, logistic costs, trainings and software licenses.
                         Additionally, six consulting contracts for studies relevant to the NUTP are underway.

                         b.       Component B - Integrated Mass Transit Systems (US$ 129 M). The cities of Bucaramanga
                         and Medellin have suffered delays in the implementation of their projects. For Bucaramanga,
                         implementing agency Metrolinea was challenged with strengthening their technical capacity to a
                         level of sufficiency. The Bank➢❨ s team is already engaged in possible solutions including scaling-
                         up implementation support and seeking additional non-reimbursable TA to assist them in improving
                         the system➢❨ s processes and operations. The contract for the Portal Giron works (US$7.5M) and its


                                                                        Page 2 of 19
                         supervision were awarded. The bidding for the Portal Norte and Portal Piedecuesta are being
                         discussed, and the possibility to use counterpart funds to finance these contracts is under
                         consideration. For Medellin-Valle de Aburra, The works contracts for Segment Quebrada de DoÃ±a

                         Maria in Itagui 4B (US$21M) and the Segment 2A in Envigado were awarded and works are
                         underway. A locally funded Envigado Corridor segment is suspended since March 2014 due to a
                         complaint against required tree downing submitted to local courts. There is still no decision from the
                         ➢❨ Consejo de Estado➢❨ . The new administration had met with the claimers looking to get an
                         agreement considering their concerns. Overall, more than US$ 75 M (58 % of the Component) have
                         been awarded or are expected to be awarded in 2016 (see annex II).

                         c.      Component C - Strategic Public Transit Systems (US$ 148 M). For Sincelejo, CECAR Stage
                         2 works (US$2.4M) and its supervision were awarded and other bidding processes are underway. For
                         Valledupar, several contracts like the historic center works (US$9.9M), the Carrera 27 works (US$
                         8.28 M) and their supervisions are expected to be awarded by the end of 2016. The challenges with
                         implementation capacity and with ➢❨ vigencias futuras➢❨ (future budget allocations) have delayed
                         the implementation for more than two years. Overall, US$ 9.0 M (6 % of the Component) have been
                         awarded, and more than US$ 39.0 M (26 % of the Component) are expected to be awarded in 2016
                         (see annex II).

                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will finance works on urban areas related to road-based transit operation. Works include
                         road maintenance and rehabilitation, segregation of lanes, pedestrian areas around the bus corridors,
                         bus stations, bridges and patios. Large cities with Bus Rapid Transit systems include the urban areas
                         of Bucaramanga, and Medellin-Valle de Aburra. These cities have been developing their BRT
                         systems through a series of Bank-financed operations (Integrated Mass Transit System Project, and
                         two subsequent Additional Financings) and one of them is already operating (Bucaramanga). With

                         respect to medium-sized cities, the proposed project will finance urban road related works in Neiva,
                         Sincelejo and Valledupar. All in all, the infrastructure works will be implemented in consolidated
                         urban areas, where traditional urban transport systems are already operating. No green-field
                         construction works will be financed.

                         Neiva is a town of about 345,000 inhabitants, of which 325,000 live in urban areas and the remaining
                         in rural areas. The project will be developed only in urban areas and its coverage is also specifically
                         urban. Neiva➢❨ s economy is based on trade, extractive activities such as oil, gas, and mining;
                         although those activities are not developed within its boundaries, it is the city where most national
                         and multinational companies are established. Another important category is metal-mechanics, also
                         related to the extractive industry.

                         With regards to the urban and environmental characteristics of the city of Neiva relevant for the
                         implementation of the Bank➢❨ s Environmental Safeguards (OP 4.01, OP 4.04 and OP 4.36) it is
                         important to highlight the presence of surface watercourses which border and cross the city, such as
                         Magdalena River, Las Ceibas River, Gold River and Bache River.

                         The design and layout of the corridors and trunk roads should recognize and protect the values and
                         environmental services associated to the protection rounds of these water bodies (in most cases the
                         protection rounds are set by the environmental authorities, its width is variable generally up to 30

                         meters on either side of the riverbed). It is desirable to include in the layout parallel road trunks to
                         water bodies, consider measures to restore and / or conserve rounds of protection for the construction
                         of linear parks, bike paths or other uses that are consistent with the Land Management Plan (POT) of

                         the cities.

                         Regarding the possible intervention and affectation of the forestation of the city, during construction
                         it was requested to the designers to consider reduce and prevent deforestation. Protection and
                         conservation of rounds of rivers could be a measure of compensation for the city➢❨ s forest heritage
                         affectation.

                         The EMF (Environmental Guidelines for Development, Implementation and Monitoring of
                         Environmental Management Plans of the Works related to the Urban Transport Project in Colombia)
                         establishes the minimum extent of Environmental Management Plans (EMP) for the construction of
                         trunk corridors, roads, bus stops, shops and other infrastructure of BRT and SETP systems. EMPs
                         include as a starting point the development of the Environmental, Biotic, Physical and
                         Socioeconomic Baseline within the direct area of influence of the project; as a result, consultants will
                         be able to determine the safety measures needed for the works carried out near the protection rounds
                         of the surface waterbodies. Baseline will also identify areas with presence of trees, green areas,
                         which could be affected to establish the necessary protection and conservation measures in the
                         design.

                         With regard to the presence of physical and cultural heritage in Neiva, there is none identified;
                         However, the EMF, specifically includes the D11 program: Management of archaeological and
                         historical heritage of the nation, which establishes the measures to be taken in case builders identify
                         archaeological finds or any historical values.

                         This categorization also reflects the fact that there are a
                         number of safeguard risks, including: (i) complex

                         management of safeguard issues due to the large scale and
                         multi-city nature of investments; (ii) the sensitive social
                         context of working in dense urban areas; and (iii) the
                         integration of new medium-sized cities to the project,
                         which have limited experience with Bank safeguard
                         requirements.

                         Proper environmental management of the project relies on
                         the development and implementation of Environmental
                         Management Plans (EMPs) for the infrastructure works.
                         To ensure that all the above referenced environmental
                         impacts and nuisances do not take place, or are properly
                         mitigated, Environmental Management Plans (EMP) will
                         have to be in place for all infrastructure works to be
                         contracted. EMPs will have to abide by the guidelines
                         included in the EMF (Guidelines for Developing,
                         Implementing and Monitoring EMPs for Urban Transport
                         Works), which have been developed by the Bank in
                         coordination with the Ministries of Environment and
                         Transport, the National Planning Department, and the
                         local Implementing Entities in large cities that were
                         financed under the prior IMTS Projects. Also, the EMF
                         has been revised to better detail the processes and
                         guidelines that will be used in medium-sized cities to
                         prepare the required EMPs, since the infrastructure works

                         will be less intensive and more geared toward the
                         rehabilitation of the existing road network.

                         EMPs are required for each of the works to be contracted
                         as part of the Project and are approved by the Bank,
                         before becoming part of the bidding documents and
                         contract obligations. Compliance is ensured through
                         contractual arrangements, conditioning payment to proper
                         EMP implementation, and levying fines for continued
                         lack of compliance with the required EMP standards.
                         EMP implementation is monitored by the works
                         supervising contractors, in addition to the weekly
                         monitoring of the Implementation Entities, and the overall
                         supervision of the Ministry of Transport, and of the Bank.

                         Experience to date with the Bank's financing of the NUTP
                         over the last seven years through three IMTS operations,
                         has proven satisfactory in term of EMP implementation
                         with performance ratings averaging over 80 percent.

                                                        low, as the problems generally refer to: (i) inadequate

                                                        coordination with the public service contractors (i.e.,
                                                        water, electricity, and communication providers); (iii)

                                                        communities living in central, dense areas. In these cases,
                                                        corrective measures have been identified, and are being
                                                        pursued by the works supervising contractors and the

                         Indigenous Peoples OP/   No    The policy remains not triggered, since in Neiva, as in

                                                        and its coverage is restricted to these areas. In this new
                                                        city, no indigenous peoples have been identified with

                                                        to a geographically defined habitat. There is also no

                         Involuntary Resettlement Yes   The policy is triggered, taking into account the need for
                         OP/BP 4.12                     purchase of land and the existence of some occupants of

                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                The Project is expected to generate long-term benefits for public transport users of cities
                              participating in the NUTP. As most of this public transport constituency is from the lower and
                              middle income strata, the Project will improve their access to services, markets and economic
                              opportunities by generating travel time and travel cost savings, improved safety and environmental
                              conditions, and better managed public spaces, among others. Through a more efficient urban
                              transport system, public transport demand will be met with fewer larger vehicles, reducing the
                              traveled km per transported passenger. Overlap routes will also be reduced. This efficiency gains
                              will represent less fuel consumption and therefore less emissions. In addition, the urban areas will
                              reorganize, improving public space, and facilitating non-motorized transport and pedestrian
                              circulation and access to the bus transit system. Moreover, accessibility and road safety get
                              improved as a result of project implementation.

                             The beneficial social impacts include among others, improved transport service provision,
                             especially for the poor; increased road safety and security for bus passengers, especially for

                             women; and improved working and living conditions for bus drivers and their families. In addition
                             to positive impacts and benefits, the project also generates adverse social impacts mainly
                             associated with the necessary acquiring of land (i.e. temporary or permanent land acquisition) for
                             civil works construction. These works cause limitation in the access to residential housing and
                             businesses, as well as the actual necessary removal of existing structures. The structures therefore
                             need to be bought and the occupants of these structures will need to be either economically or
                             physically resettled, or both. When an affected social unit needs to be resettled, the project
                             provides sufficient compensation and support so that the social unit can restore their livelihoods or
                             standards of living to pre-resettlement levels.

                             When the original IMTS project (2004) was being prepared, it was not possible to determine the
                             exact location (and road alignment) for project activities, so in compliance with Bank safeguard
                             procedures, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared, approved by the Bank, and
                             disclosed. Large cities participating in the program have used the resettlement approach outlined
                             in the RPF to prepare Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), which have been subjected to Bank
                             review, disclosure, and have been closely supervised by the Bank team over the last seven years.
                             These same RAPs will apply to the investments financed for large cities under this Project, and the
                             task team will continue to supervise them. To date, 29 RAPs have been prepared in these large
                             cities. The proposed support to the NUTP project resources will finance investments for the
                             remaining civil works associated with these RAPs. If designs change or if additional investments,

                                                                        Page 9 of 19
                         not financed under previous phases of the Bank's support, are at some point included under this
                         Project, new RAPs would be prepared and subject to review and disclosure in accordance with
                         Bank policy. Otherwise, for large cities under this project, no additional RAP would be prepared

                         and the existing documents will continue to be used. The existing EMPs and RAPs for large cities
                         financed under this Project will be re-disclosed on August 31/16. The Government has also
                         committed to a large post-re settlement evaluation to generate quantitative and qualitative
                         indicators as to the wellbeing of affected peoples. At the outset of the NUTP, the Government
                         deemed it most appropriate to undertake such an evaluation at the completion of the overall
                         program, and such an assessment will be an important input into this Project ICR.

                         For the medium-sized cities, the NUTP project would operate under a similar approach. Since at
                         this point in time it is not possible to determine the exact alignment of project investments in
                         medium-sized cities, a resettlement framework approach will be used. The Resettlement Policy
                         Framework (which is closely based on the original framework prepared for large cities) has been
                         revised to adjust for a slightly different orientation of the activities in the medium-sized cities (for
                         example, this project expects less impacts on properties but more impact on informal vendors),
                         and was disclosed on February 10, 2011. During Project implementation, medium-sized cities will
                         use this framework to prepare RAPs once the detailed designs of civil works and other
                         interventions are known. Project resources will only finance such investments once RAPs are
                         prepared, approved, and disclosed.

                         As part of the IMTS Second Additional Financing, an independent evaluation was commissioned
                         to assess implementation of RAPs in large cities (RAPs that have been concluded (13) and RAPs
                         which are under implementation (16). Although the study is not yet finalized, the major
                         conclusions so far are as follows [Final Deliverable of Study under revision by task team; to be
                         included in Project Files]:

                          (i)     The Project fully satisfies the requirements and guidelines as set forth by OP 4.12
                         (Involuntary Resettlement). For example, in the local Implementing Entities teams have developed

                         effective consultation and participation strategies, which have allowed the public and the affected
                         people to efficiently communicate concerns about the Project. Teams in local Implementing
                         Entities can also demonstrate how they have successfully managed to reduce resettlement-related
                         impacts. The Ministry of Transport (MT) has created subsidies to assist particularly vulnerable
                         affected people, and has designed specific measures to ensure a fast and effective compensation
                         program. In general, the Project is conceived and implemented as a sustainable development
                         program.
                          (ii)    The development of a RPF has guaranteed a systematic planning and implementation of
                         the Project➢❨ s social management issues and has helped implement a more consistent and
                         systematic application of the Bank➢❨ s safeguard requirements, despite the complexities
                         associated with carrying out a Project in numerous cities.
                          (iii)   The cost of resettlement in the IMTS Project is lower than the cost which has been
                         recorded in other projects in Colombia. The cost of resettlement in the IMTS Project ranges from 8
                         to 12 percent of the total cost of each sub-project.
                          (iv)    The resettlement components of the Project stand out for their efficiency, transparency and
                         absence of conflicts. Delays and required additional investments have been observed in the
                         implementation of other Project components (i.e. civil work contracts); however this does not
                         apply to implementation of the RAPs, which has been carried out in an efficient, timely and
                         transparent manner.


                                                                    Page 10 of 19
                          (v)     Administrative expropriations have been registered in only one of the sub-projects. The
                         social and legal studies showed that many properties had several constraints and charges attached
                         to the property titles. As a solution, the property owners were offered financial assistance (which

                         they otherwise would not have been entitled to), if they agreed to resettle within the time period
                         required by the Project.
                          (vi)    Multi-disciplinary teams have improved resettlement process. The creation of multi-
                         disciplinary teams (social, legal and technical specialists) has allowed for a more comprehensive
                         approach to managing social and resettlement issues, and for a better interaction with the
                         community.
                          (vii) The successful implementation of RAPs in the IMTS Project has favorably changed the
                         public➢❨ s opinion of the civil work and has created important local capacity in social
                         management practices.

                         The city of Pereira is cited as an outstanding example where the inter-agency coordination was led
                         by the manager at the local Implementing Entity and where resettlement implementation was
                         successful.

                          The evaluation study also identified a number of difficulties and areas for improvement. For
                         example, frequent changes in the design of works resulted in changes in the resettlement process
                         and cause anxiety from the social units involved; However, the project has not jeopardized the
                         economic recovery of those affected and have received sufficient compensation (i.e. lease, rent,
                         loss of economic activity), and found suitable solutions for street vendors.

                         The evaluation study identifies lessons learned and recommendations. For example, evaluation of
                         impacts must include the analysis of vulnerable people and communities; disclosure should focus
                         more on users of transportation and include their views; the compassionate relationship between
                         project affected people and the resettlement teams in local Implementing Entities has allowed for
                         faster agreements. In terms of recommendations, the assessment suggests including subsidies and
                         additional economic compensation in the resettlement process and allowing for recognition of

                         impacts due to civil work delays.

                         In the case of Neiva, the city recently included, the properties to be acquired are identified, but the
                         census of households and economic activities has not been provided, so this information is not
                         available yet. On the other hand, the two RAP's expected to be formulated correspond to sections
                         of works that are not a priority yet and therefore the census activity is best done when having the
                         schedule prepared not to raise expectations. The census and corresponding RAP will be made
                         according to the Resettlement Policy Framework. No construction will start until these RAPs have
                         been prepared, consulted and disclosed.

                         In the medium-sized cities, the properties to acquire are 90 in Sincelejo, 45 in Valledupar and167
                         in Neiva. These figures are approximate, and the land acquisition plan for Neiva is still wai ting
                         for approval.

                         The current status of RAPs in large cities participating in the NUTP is shown in Table 2. The
                         resettlement process in Bucaramanga is almost completed. In the Medellin Metropolitan area,
                         significant resettlement, relocation of street vendors, and land acquisition is expected to take place
                         during the implementation period of this operation per the construction schedule of the systems in
                         these cities.

                         In addition, new resettlement plans are expected to be approved during implementation: two new
                         plans in Nei va (by the Implementing Agency Transfederal), one in Sincelejo and two in

                         In Medellin, a large number of properties are also to be affected during the implementation of this
                         phase of the NUTP. Medellin➢❨ s subproject encompasses the entirety of themetropolitan area
                         (which includes Medellin, Envigado and Itagui) and the remaining investments to be undertaken
                         are almost entir ely in Envigado and Itagui. All of the outstanding properties (1074) being affected
                         are related with infrastructure investments taking place in Envigado and Itagui and are being
                         financed under this Project. It is expected that approximately 70 percent of these properties will be
                         resettled by end of 2016 and the remaining number of proper ties by 2017. To accomplish this, the
                         social teams have been strengthened as requested by the Bank, and now Envigado has gone from 1
                         social specialist to a team of 8 social/legal specialist to manage the resettlement process, and Itagui
                         from 2 social specialists to a team of 10. To date, resettlement and land acquisition in Medellin has
                         been highly satisfactory.

                          Project risks that go beyond the coverage of the safeguards may include, for example, those
                         related to the ongoing conflict and violence that still permeates part of Colombia. Sincelejo, one of
                         the medium-sized cities included in the project, is a city where half of the population has been
                         displaced by such violence. Other risks may include the loss of jobs for those informal bus drivers
                         and ➢❨ motorcycle-taxis➢❨ that may not be captured by the new formal bus system or included

                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                             No long-term negative impacts are expected, and most negative impacts are temporary. On the
                           other hand, positive long term impacts are expected, as accessibility and road safety are improved,
                           public urban space is enhanced, and emissions and exposure to local pollutants are diminished.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                             N.A.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                             The borrower has developed a strong institutional capacity to ensure implementation of the
                           Bank's environmental and social safeguards. This capacity has been acquired through the
                           implementation of the IMTS Project (original Loan and two subsequent Additional Loan
                           financings), which has helped develop efficient urban transport systems using BRTs in the cities of
                           Barranquilla, BogotÃ¡, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, Medellin, and Pereira.

                          At the national level, the implementing agency of the NUTP is the Ministry of Transport (MT),
                          which has established a strong Project Coordination Unit (UMUS, Sustainable Urban Mobility
                          Unit), staffed by a mix of civil servants and individual consultants, including urban transport
                          engineers, economists, accountants and social and environmental specialists, among others. The
                          unit provides direct support to the participating cities and local Implementing Entities in technical,
Public Disclosure Copy




                          operational, environmental, social/resettlement, and procurement aspects. In the PCU there is an
                          Environmental Specialist and a Social Specialist, who provide assistance to the local
                          Implementing Agencies with regards to the EMP and RAP development, implementation and
                          monitoring. MT reports to the Bank on compliance with the Environmental and Social Safeguards
                          and accompanies the Bank on the overall Project supervision.

                           At the local level, Implementing Agencies in large cities have also been staffed with
                          multidisciplinary teams, including Environmental and Social Specialists. Likewise, civil works
                          contractors, and works supervision contractors are also required to have proper environmental and
                          social specialists in their teams. During supervision missions of the IMTS project, the team has
                          found that, in general, the environmental and social management teams are dedicated,
                          hardworking and with high professional standards. Where the Bank team has identified problems
                          of lack of capacity, as has been the case in Bucaramanga, the implementing agencies have taken
                          measures to improve staff composition and performance. In medium-sized cities, local
                          Implementing Entities have been established and are in the process of staffing their units, with
                          social and environmental specialist to manage safeguard issues. Knowledge-transfer is also taking
                          place between large and medium -sized cities, so that the newly created entities in medium-sized
                          cities are aware of the lessons learnt and practices that have worked in terms of environmental and
                          social management in large cities.

                         Environmental Management Plans. The environmental specialist in the Implementing Entity is in
                         charge of developing the EMPs for all infrastructure works to be contracted in their cities. EMPs
                         become part of the bidding documents for contracting the construction and infrastructure works

                         required for the urban transport project restructuring at each of the participating urban areas. Once
                         contracts are awarded, the construction contractors need to develop a Plan for the Implementation
                         of the EMP. Infrastructure works also require contracting of a supervision contractor. The
                         supervision contractor oversees implementation of works in accordance with bidding documents,
                         and design and infrastructure plans. Both the civil works contractors and the supervision
                         contractors are staffed with environmental (i.e. environmental and occupational health) and social
                         specialists. Every day, the supervision contractor fills in a checklist on the Plan for the
                         implementation of the EMP compliance, which is later discussed on a weekly meeting with a
                         committee composed also by the environmental and social specialists from the civil works
                         contractors and by the environmental and social specialists from the local Implementing Entity. At
                         the end of the month a compiled report on EMP compliance is produced by the works supervision
                         contractor, and submitted to the environmental specialist at the PCU. This report presents an
                         overall evaluation and ratings on the different EMP programs. If the ratings are below 100 percent,
                         the civil works contractor does not receive full payment of its claimed expenses related to EMP
                         implementation. Rather, it its reimbursed, in accordance to the performance rating obtained. If an
                         EMP activity is not complied with, for subsequent periods of time, the contractor may get a
                         warning and/or a fine. A fine will affect their scorecard to contract with the Government in the
                         future.

                         To help local Implementing Entities deal with EMPs, the Bank developed an Environmental
                         Management Framework (Guidelines for the Development, Implementation and Monitoring of
                         EMPs related to Urban Transport Infrastructure Work). The EMF has been jointly developed by
                         the Bank, the Ministries of Environment, and Transport, the National Planning Department, and
                         the Implementing Entities in large cities that participated under the IMTS operations. The EMF is
                         designed to ensure proper environmental management of the main aspects related to the
                         infrastructure works, including:
Public Disclosure Copy




                          (i)     Environmental Management System, which establishes the institutional requirements to
                         implement the EMP, including proper staffing, and the procedures for following up and rating
                         performance;
                          (ii)    Environmental Management of Works. This section of the EMF includes programs for
                         proper management of wastes, materials, lubricants and fuels, camp sites, equipment and
                         machinery, so that noise, potential emissions and liquid discharge s are prevented or mitigated.
                         The section also includes measures to isolate work s, demolition and excavation areas from people
                         and vehicles, and proper signaling. This chapter includes a program for proper management of
                         historic patrimony and heritage, and set up procedures in case of chance finds. Also, there are
                         programs for proper excavation and demolishing practices.
                          (iii)   Traffic Management. These programs are designed to avoid conflicts of transport modes,
                         including pedestrians, with the works areas. It helps keep safe walking and circulating paths, and
                         makes sure that the affected community are properly consulted and informed.
                          (iv)    Industrial Safety and Occupational Health. This program includes all relevant measures to
                         ensure safety and occupational health, and it relates to minimum requirements for proper gear,
                         safety procedures, and contingencies plan.
                          (v)     Management of Trees and Green Coverage. These programs are designed to protect and

                          For the new medium-sized cities participating in the Project since 2011 (i.e., Sincelejo, and
                          Valledupar), Implementing Entities included social and environmental specialists during all the
                          implementation process, and have received support from the Bank➢❨ s specialists. The newly
                          created Implementing Entity in Neiva will appoint environment al and social specialists, who will
                          be trained by both the MT and the Bank. The first bidding documents and works supervision will
                          require a close follow-up from the MT and the Bank, to ensure proper application of the EMF and
                          the RPF, as happened in Sincelejo and Valledupar.

                           Resettlement Action Plans. Under the IMTS operations, the Bank has generally documented very
                           good implementation of RAPs in large cities. As explained above the Project in large cities will
                           continue to be implemented by local Implementing Entities in each city. Each of these units has a
                           social sub-unit which manages social issues, in particular the resettlement components. The
                           number of staff in these social management teams varies from just a few, in, for example,
                           Bucaramanga, to a large team in Medellin. The composition of the social management teams is
                           diverse and consists of anthropologists, sociologists, economists, lawyers, social workers,
                           psychologists, administrative staff and others. During supervision missions of the IMTS project,
                           the team has found that, in general, the social management teams are dedicated, hardworking and
                           with high professional standards. Where the Bank team has identified problems of lack of
                           capacity, the implementing agencies have taken measures to improve staff composition and
                           performance, for example in Cartagena. In medium-sized cities, local Implementing Entities have
                           been established and are in the process of staffing their units, with social and environmental
                           specialists to manage safeguard issues. Knowledge-transfer is also taking place between large and
                           medium-sized cities, so that the newly created entities in medium-sized cities are aware of the

                           lessons learnt and practices that have worked in terms of social management in large cities. For
                           instance, the Implementing Entities in medium-sized cities participated in a two-day safeguards
                           workshop (October 2010) with the social and environmental teams of the large cities in order to
                           learn from each other and exchange experiences on the implementation of the Bank➢❨ s safeguard
                           policies. At the national level, the PCU (UMUS) is also staffed with an experienced social
                           specialist that helps cities participating in the NUTP manage social and environmental issues
                           according to the Bank➢❨ s safeguard standards. Staff from the implementing agencies and the
                           PCU held annual meetings for learning activities about social and environmental safeguards. The
                           major issue that still needs to show better progress is the resettlement of street vendors. The
                           conversion from the informal to the formal sector will require improved collaboration with the
                           respective municipalities.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                             Social assessments are integral parts of RAPs. The 29 RAPs which have been and are being
                           implemented in large cities, all include extensive social assessment information. This information
                           is the baseline data which is necessary in order to prepare and execute resettlement action plans.
                           Medium sized cities will follow the same methodology used in the preparation of the RAPs for the
                           large cities, and will follow the same methodology as in the large cities when preparing to carry
                           out social assessments. The social assessments have and will include information, but not

                         on economic, social and cultural diversity (including gender);
                          #       Estimated impacts on people and property, including social risks which are closely
                         associated with the impacts;

                          In fact, the implementation of the IMTS Project has made a specific effort to pay particular
                         attention to the very poor and vulnerable. Therefore, we find in each participating city, a large
                         number of identifiable cases of vulnerable social units, which have received noteworthy and
                         exceptional assistance. For example, members of the social/resettlement teams in all the large
                         cities have gone far beyond the call of duty in assisting particularly vulnerable families and until
                         now they maintain strong bonds with these families. This very special support and dedication to
                         assist those most in need, has also resulted in municipal decrees, which legalize additional support
                         to vulnerable cases (for example in Bucaramanga). In addition, as part of the social assessments,
                         the implementing agencies will command studies that identify the key stakeholders and the
                         mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially
                         affected people. Key stakeholders in the Project include those living, working or moving along the
                         bus routes, including residents, shop-owners, informal vendors, other merchants, bus users, bus
                         operators, and bus drivers.

                         The Project initiated consultations with potentially affected people early on. Stakeholders involved
                         in consultations during preparations included, among others, people affected by land acquisition,
                         bus owners, private transport associations, local government, and central government officials.

                         During project implementation in large cities, the GoC and local Implementing Entities have
                         collaborated with construction companies and bus operators to share information and allow public
                         consultation through information offices, workshops, and information dissemination material. The
                         consultation process has been instrumental in informing the Project➢❨ s design and environmental
                         and social management. For instance, in Medellin (Envigado) citizens have contributed to
                         overseeing project implementation and monitoring, and in Bucaramanga consultations resulted in
                         key adjustment to the project➢❨ s design in order to improve public space layout and promote the
                         pedestrian mobility. In medium-sized cities, the consultation process also initiated early-on and
                         has included a number of workshops, formal and informal meetings with public transport users,
                         bus owners, private transport associations, local government, and GoC officials, among others.
                         Two workshops on Bank (July 22, 2010) fiduciary and safeguards policies (October 7, 2010) took
                         place during Project preparation as an initial approach to share with medium-sized cities policies
                         that would be applicable in the Project. These workshops were extremely useful for relevant
                         stakeholders in medium-sized cities, since representatives from large cities where the Project is
                         already being implemented shared their experiences on fiduciary and safeguard issues.
                         Furthermore, during January 18 and, 19, 2011 consultation meetings took place in Sincelejo and
                         Valledupar, respectively, to socialize the RPF with key stakeholders. Stakeholders included
                         potential public transport users, representatives from territorial social organizations (Juntas de
                         AcciÃ³n Comunal),municipal government officials, city council members, education centers and

                         of Sincelejo and Vall edupar, and assistance in each of the three cities surpassed 50 people. Once

                         the RPF was presented and disseminated, and its application to the Project was explained, the
                         Bank answered questions from the audience including issues regarding to project timing and
                         execution of civil works, treatment of affected properties under the project, best practices in large
                         cities in terms of community involvement/management, importance of developing programs to
                         address the occupation of public space and street vendors, solutions and regulation to tackle
                         motorcycle cabs (mototaxismo), and requests to update proposals to the Land Use Plan, among
                         others. Feedback around the issues of street vendors and informal occupation of public space has
                         been reflected in the RPF, and will be crucial for the proper management of social issues is
                         medium-sized cities.

                         The EMF was also consulted with relevant stakeholders. Participants included representatives
                         from the community (i.e., local neighborhood boards); engineers; consultants; members of the
                         Universities, transport operators, and the media. At the meetings the EMF was socialized, and the
                         procedures for developing and implementing specific EMPs in the future were presented. No
                         significant issues were raised and all participants welcomed the environmental management
                         standards presented, and expressed their interest in participating in future consultation events. At
                         the city of Neiva, these consultations will also be carried out once the documents are ready to be
                         presented. Regarding the Environmental Management Plans, the promoter of the BRT / SETP
                         system and the contractor of the works will socialize them to the communities in the area of direct
                         influence. EMPs have clearly established the responsibility of socialization, through programs B1:
                         Community information and B2: Disclosure.

                         In terms of disclosure the RPF, EMF and all EMPs, RAPs, have been disclosed through the
                         Bank➢❨ s external website and the MOT, and local Implementing Entities.

                          In terms of grievance mechanisms, the Project has in place a number of systems to receive, solve
Public Disclosure Copy




                         and track complaints. The most important one is the Centers for Public Attention, which not only
                         operate as a mechanisms for ongoing project consultation, but also receive and help solve
                         complaints. Before any civil work starts, as required by EMPs a Center for Public Consultation is
                         established in the corridor neighborhood. These centers become the point of contact with the local
                         community regarding questions and complaints, and also serve as a mechanism for receiving
                         questions, claims and complaints. In fact, the Centers for Public Attention all have records of the
                         state of properties (i.e., ➢❨ Actas de Vecindad➢❨ ), in the project area # before and after the
                         project. The Centers are also used to socialize the project and publicize traffic measures, works
                         plans and work progress. The Centers for Public Attention is, for the Project, probably the most
                         important point of contact with the public. Apart from this mechanism, each local Implementing
                         Entity also has several procedures for receiving, processing and solving claims and grievances.
                         Claims can be posted on the website, received in the office of the Implementing Entity or in a local
                         office in the field. In each city, every step of this process is very well documented and the teams
                         also digitalize all information.

                         Handling petitions, queries, complaints or suggestions - PQRS, comes forward to all kinds of
                         situations, including resettlement. The mechanism is easily accessible through the attention office
                         (s) available in the area of works, website, mail, telephone, or by contacting the social
                         professionals in the works or office. All complaints are monitored by the Implementing Entity and

                           also by the UEP of the Ministry of Transport. Historically, the management of PQRS in the
                           Transport Project has shown efficiency and effectiveness, expressed in the low level of conflict
                           and satisfactory resolution to the parties in almost all cases.
