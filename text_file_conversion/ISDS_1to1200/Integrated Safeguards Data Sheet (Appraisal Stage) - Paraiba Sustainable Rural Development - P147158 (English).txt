                           The objective of the Project is to improve access to water, reduce agro-climatic vulnerability and
                           increase access to markets of Paraiba's rural inhabitants.
                            3. Project Description


                                                                        Page 1 of 10
                         Beneficiaries:

                         The target population consists of about 165,000 rural inhabitants, whose livelihoods depend

                         primarily on small-scale agricultural production, transformation and related services. Potential
                         beneficiaries would be targeted through different instruments depending on their characteristics.
                         Investments in water supply and in agro-climatic vulnerability reduction will be targeted at farmers
                         and households living in 100 municipalities in the semi-arid region, selected on the basis of a
                         Municipal Index of Agro-climatic Vulnerability, which combines climate, agriculture production,
                         and social and human development indicators. Eligible municipalities have high or medium-high
                         levels of vulnerability. Indigenous and Quilombola communities will be eligible regardless of
                         location in the state. Investments in productive alliances would not be targeted spatially but aimed at
                         smallholder producers, mostly family farmers, organized in existing or new producer associations
                         throughout the state. Implementation of the agro-climatic risk information system will generate
                         benefits for the population of the whole state, as it would improve planning and early alerts and
                         provide information for better-targeted mitigation.

                         analysis (if known)
                         ParaÃ-ba is among Brazil?s smaller states, both in terms of size (56,000 km2) and population (3.4
                         million). The state is also exceptionally poor even by Northeast standards. Paraiba?s poverty and
                         extreme poverty reach 28.2 and 8.1 percent, respectively, and two-fifths of Paraiba families live on
                         less than one-half of the minimum wage (versus 22% nationwide). About 29% of the total state

                         population resides in rural areas, where the share of households living on less than one-half the
                         minimum wage rises to 56%.

                         The project area encompasses rural areas in 222 municipalities of the state of ParaÃ-ba. The
                         vulnerability reduction component focuses on the 100 municipalities with the lowest Human
                         Development Index (HDI) rates, lowest rainfall levels and highest population density. Most of these
                         are located in semi-arid regions, which experience significant environmental degradation and chronic
                         water scarcity, with long and severe droughts. The productive alliances component will cover all
                         rural areas of the State.

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The bulk of project activities should be of low, localized and reversible environmental impact.
                              Preventive and mitigation measures were identified, particularly for activities that require more
                              attention, such as the construction of water uptake and distribution systems and sanitary kits,

                              irrigation, fisheries and other rural production activities.
                              Given the impacts from fisheries activities, which are compounded by the long drought currently
                              affecting most of the project target area, no fisheries activities will be financed within existing
                              reservoirs. If funded, this type of productive activity will only be supported if fish are raised in
                              dug-out ponds and if adequate water supply is guaranteed.
                              The project will also support the improvement of feeder roads leading to rural communities,
                              including the construction of small bridges at fords, to improve year-round access to markets and
                              services. Project preparation involved discussions with the state's environmental and water
                              agencies, which contributed to define best practices which were included in the ESIA.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                              No indirect or long-term negative impacts are anticipated.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                              N/A

                              assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                              The borrower prepared an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA), which includes a
                              focused analysis of the social and environmental context and the potential (positive and adverse)

                           client at http://www.cooperar.pb.gov.br/index.php?pg=documentos_oficiais. The current project
                           built on lessons learned from the previous operation and prepared robust screening procedures for
                           subproject selection, as well as monitoring and evaluation tools.
                           Project implementation arrangements include a safeguards management unit with two staff.
                           Following Bank recommendations and given the large number of subprojects foreseen for this
                           operation, the project team should be reinforced with two more technical staff responsible for
                           safeguards compliance at the central management unit (one social, one environmental), in addition
                           to one technical staff in each of the regional units trained for field supervision of safeguards
                           compliance.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           As agreed with the Bank, the Borrower implemented the following plan for consultation and
                           disclosure: in early April 2015, the draft ESIA was consulted in four face-to-face regional
                           workshops covering the entire project area (SertÃ£o, Borborema, Agreste Paraibano, and Mata
                           Paraibana), and in parallel, through a broader online consultation using the state?s social networks
                           and the project?s website (http://www.cooperar.pb.gov.br/). The final document incorporates
                           comments received during the consultation process and was disclosed on 03 July 2015 at the
