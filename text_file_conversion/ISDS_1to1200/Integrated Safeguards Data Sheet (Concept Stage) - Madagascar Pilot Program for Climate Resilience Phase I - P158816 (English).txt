                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The proposed project development objective is to formulate a Strategic Program for Climate
                           Resilience (SPCR) and its relevant investment plan and to establish the enabling environment for its
                           implementation.
                           C. Project Description
                           The objective of the PPCR is to pilot and demonstrate ways to integrate climate risk information and
                           resilience into core development planning, while complementing other ongoing activities. Within the
                           context of Madagascar, the Government suggested in its expression of interest that was submitted to
                           the CIF in March 2015, several priority sectors. These sectors have been stated as priority actions in
                           the Government of Madagascar's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) -
                           Contribution Prevue Determinee au niveau National (CPDN), which was developed in preparation
                           for COP21. The following sectors are particularly targeted: agriculture, fishing, livestock farming,
                           forests, water and environment. The high biodiversity of Madagascar plays a significant role in
                           adaptation and some analytical work could explore the policy implications for conservation as well
                           as the possibility of piloting ecosystem-based adaptation.

                           The SPCR could also help explain to what extent the severity of the drought spells are caused by
                           human interference in natural resources, such as forest removal for charcoal production, and explore
                           water management techniques in the semi-arid that could be deployed in Madagascar's Southern
                           region.

                           Resilience within public infrastructure has also been identified as a priority sector, along with the
                           protection of coastal zones. Finally, the production of and access to climate-related data that must be
                           improved through the strengthening of hydro-meteorological services will also be considered a
                           priority. Those sectors are primarily linked to vulnerability in rural areas. However, urban resilience
                           in Madagascar should also be examined in the development of the SPCR. This also applies to
                           resilience in budgeting and public spending, as the country's fiscal vulnerability limits its capacity to
                           mobilize resources when a disaster strikes.

                           In line with the above, proposed activities will be articulated around the four following components:
                           -        Strengthening knowledge on climate resilience and climate risk management in Madagascar
                           (building on on-going risk modeling activities implemented under the SWIO-RAFI ASA);
                           -        Establishing an enabling institutional environment favorable to the development and
                           implementation of the SPCR and to the mainstreaming of climate resilience into development
                           planning and capacity building;
                           -        Supporting the identification, prioritization and planning of the interventions, consultation
                           process, and investment feasibilities;
                           -        Supporting the implementing agency in the execution and monitoring and evaluation of the
                           proposed activities.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The Investment Plan/ Strategic program for climate resilience preparation is assigned an EA category
                           of "C" as this activity poses low or no safeguards risk and specific Safeguards policies will not be
                           triggered as no physical investment will be financed through this operation.
