   The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and
   climate change impacts in Saint Lucia.
   B. Proposed Project Development Objectives – Additional Financing (AF)


 3. Project Description
The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project (DVRP)
is to reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change impacts in Saint Lucia. The
achievement of the PDO is supported by the following five project components: (1) Risk Reduction
and Adaptation Measures; (2) Technical Assistance for Improved Assessment and Application of
Disaster and Climate Risk Information in Decision-Making; (3) Climate Adaptation Financing
Facility (CAFF) ; (4) Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC) ; and (5) Project
Management and Implementation Support. The original financing for the DVRP in the amount of
USD 68 million equivalent, comprised a USD 41 million equivalent in IDA Credit, USD 12 million
in Grant from the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) through the Climate Investment Fund’s (CIF) Pilot
Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) and USD 15 million in PPCR concessional loan. AF and
EDF grant funds will, however, exclusively support Component 1 and Component 5 of the DVRP,
with the additional USD 8.00 million equivalent. Activities financed by the proposed AF and EDF
grant are consistent with interventions included under the original DVRP in that they focus on
investments in the transport, health and education sectors. Specifically, AF and EDF grant activities
under Component 1 (USD 7.6 million equivalent) would further reduce climate change vulnerability
by potentially financing: (i) construction of a new Piaye Bridge (22 meters); (ii) reconstruction of the
Venus – Anse La Raye Road (8.2 km); (iii) rehabilitation and reconstruction of prioritized schools
and health centers; and (iv) technical assessments and supervision of works; while AF activities
under Component 5 (USD 0.4 million equivalent) will scale-up overall project management.
 4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
The AF and EDF grant will primarily finance a road rehabilitation project (Venus – Anse La Raye)
which was assessed in the original EMF developed for the Parent project (disclosed on January
2014), a bridge reconstruction project (Piaye) and rehabilitations of select education and health
facilities. All sites were field-visited and preliminarily assessed by World Bank safeguards
specialists. The road segment will traverse interior areas with well-preserved natural habitat, and will
therefore require additional assessment work once detailed designs are known, as already described
in the original EMF; and, the bridge is relatively simple and may rely on standard measures already
outlined in the existing EMF. The EMF for the Parent Project include environmental management
procedures for project typologies which are very similar to the new AF and EDF grant works.
Therefore, the EMF (updated in February and March 2016) did not need to be substantively revised
for the AF and EDF grant, as the protocols to be followed have already been adequately described,
and only a brief discussion and update to the list of sub-projects was required, as well as a
clarification that the Pest Management Policy would be triggered to allow for incidental pesticide use
or purchase through licensed registered professional contractors (e.g. termite treatments for building
foundations).

With respect to Social Safeguards, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF - disclosed on January
2014) was developed for the Parent Project to provide guidelines for the development of instruments
(e.g. Resettlement Action Plans, Temporary Resettlement Plans, Compensation Plans) to mitigate


                                             Page 2 of 10
land acquisition and/or other social issues that arise from works undertaken under the parent DVRP.
Given that the activities planned under the AF are similar in nature and extent to those under the
parent project, the RPF did not require substantive revision, and was updated to reflect the additional
investments under AF and EDF grant. A discrete amount of land acquisition is envisaged under the
AF, so the existing RPF will guide the development and implementation of Resettlement Action
Plans and associated compensatory and mitigation measures .

6. Safeguard Policies        Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental                Yes            An Environmental Assessment (EA) as well as an
Assessment OP/BP 4.01                       environmental safeguards instrument (Environmental
                                            Management Framework – EMF) have been prepared by
                                            an external consultant, to preliminarily assess potential
                                            subprojects and to present appropriate screening methods
                                            and procedures for the application of Bank safeguards,
                                            including guidance on the scope of studies required to
                                            complete for each subproject as well as criteria for
                                            triggering additional studies in the case of complex or
                                            significant activities (e.g, Venus – Anse La Raye Road)
                                            once design details are known. For relatively simple
                                            projects, a generic Environmental Management Plan
                                            (EMP) will suffice and is already included in the EMF.
                                            The studies and management plans related to each
                                            subproject should be completed prior to commencement
                                            of any work. The majority of works will likely be small-
                                            scale and simple in nature with environmental impacts
                                            limited to the construction phase, requiring only the
                                            application of the standardized and generic EMP. Any
                                            exceptions will be identified during the screening phase
                                            (as detailed in the EMF) and additional assessment work
                                            will be done during project implementation, if required.
Natural Habitats OP/BP       Yes            OP/BP 4.04 has been triggered as a precaution to ensure
4.04                                        the development and inclusion of clear screening criteria
                                            related to natural habitats within the EMF. Work in forest
                                            reserve areas, along coastlines, and in sensitive riparian
                                            areas may activate this policy and require additional
                                            assessment.
Forests OP/BP 4.36           No             Additional research and subsequent definition of
                                            subprojects during project preparation have shown that
                                            this safeguard will not be triggered. Planned watershed
                                            management activities and slope stabilization works will
                                            not impact the management, protection and/or utilization
                                            of forests nor are any projects involving harvesting or



                                             Page 3 of 10
                               converting forest resources considered under the project.
Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes    The Pest Management Policy has been triggered to allow
                               for incidental pesticide use (e.g. termite treatment for
                               building foundations), as needed, using licensed
                               professional contractors. The use or purchase of
                               significant amounts of pesticide will be excluded in the
                               screening process described in the updated EMF.
                               Accordingly, no separate Pest Management Plan is
                               needed; rather the EMF includes appropriate procedures
                               in the form of a generic standardized EMP for
                               incorporation into contract clauses.
Physical Cultural        Yes   Chance-find procedures as well as historic building
Resources OP/BP 4.11           screening procedures have been included in the
                               environmental safeguards instruments. Stakeholder
                               contribution to conceptual design of building
                               rehabilitation will also be solicited, if deemed necessary.
Indigenous Peoples OP/   No    Screening was conducted by the World Bank and an
BP 4.10                        independent consultant during project preparation to
                               determine whether Indigenous Populations are present in
                               the project area. The screening confirmed that while
                               populations who claim indigenous descent exist in the
                               project area, these groups no longer retain the minimum
                               characteristics necessary to claim indigenous group
                               affiliation under Bank Policy OP/BP 4.10.
Involuntary Resettlement Yes   A discrete amount of land acquisition is envisaged and
OP/BP 4.12                     any potentially negative impacts will be mitigated. The
                               PCU is in the process of hiring a Social Development
                               Specialist and already has a Communications / Liaison
                               Officer on the team. The PCU has experience with the
                               Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12), through the
                               implementation of other Bank financed projects, and core
                               members of the PCU have also recently received capacity
                               building in the implementation of OP 4.12. Should the
                               development of Resettlement Plans become necessary, the
                               Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), developed prior to
                               the appraisal of the Parent Project, will guide the
                               development and implementation of Resettlement Action
                               Plans and associated compensatory and mitigatory
                               measures. Given the activities planned under the AF are
                               similar in nature and extent to those under the Parent
                               Project, the RPF does not require substantive revision,
                               however will be updated to reflect the additional
                               investments under AF.

                               Project funds will not finance land acquisition/
                               compensation/resettlement costs.

   Safety of Dams OP/BP        No            OP/BP 4.37 has not been triggered as flood control works
   4.37                                      and river defense structures are a few meters high (at
                                             most).
   Projects on International   No            Planned works under the project are exclusively located
   Waterways OP/BP 7.50                      on the island of Saint Lucia and not in the proximity of
                                             any International Waterways, as defined by OP/BP 7.50.
   Projects in Disputed        No            Planned works under the project are exclusively located

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
    A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
   1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
     and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
     In accordance with Bank environmental safeguards requirements, the project is classified as
     Category B, and the policy on Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) is triggered. Natural
     Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) was also triggered and the EMF requires additional assessment work for the
     Venus – Anse La Raye road which traverses sensitive ecosystems, as already detailed in the EMF.
     Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) was also triggered as a precaution in case of chance
     finds of historically or culturally significant resources during construction of works, particularly
     during activities such as major excavations, road realignments or similar works where such assets
     could be affected. In addition, Pest Management (OP/BP 4.09) has been triggered under the AF to
     allow for incidental pesticide use (e.g. termite treatment for building foundations) applied by
     licensed professional contractors, if needed. The use or purchase of significant amounts of
     pesticide will be excluded in the screening process described in the updated EMF. Given the small
     amounts of pesticides expected to be used under the Project, a separate Pest Management Plan will
     not be required; instead, the EMF includes appropriate procedures in the form of a generic
     standardized EMP for incorporation into contract clauses. Overall, there are no large scale,
     significant, or irreversible impacts identified.

    In accordance with Bank Social Safeguards requirements, OP/BP 4.12 is triggered given the
    likelihood that sub-project sites financed by the AF and EDF grant could lead to land acquisition,
    depending on final designs. Any potentially negative impacts with respect to land acquisition and/
    or resettlement would be minor in nature and will be mitigated by the presence of a Social
    Development Specialist within the PCU, tasked with community outreach and consultation to
    affected persons, and the development and implementation of Resettlement Action Plans and
    associated compensatory and mitigatory measures in line with the RPF developed for the Parent
    Project (dated January 2014). The RPF has been updated (March 2016) to reflect the new AF
    project suite. The findings of the social assessment, conducted during the preparation of the Parent
    Project, remain valid, given that the activities planned under the AF and EDF grant are similar in
    nature and extent to those under the parent. The social benefits of the parent project are expected
    to be positive and will remain so under with the expanded scope of activities. Improved
    infrastructure resilience as a result of bridge and road rehabilitation will likely lead to reduced
    exposure of beneficiaries to natural disaster-related disruptions in the lives of the beneficiary
    communities and school and hospital upgrades should promote an increased sense of safety and
    security. There are no large scale, significant, or irreversible impacts identified from a social


                                               Page 5 of 10
  perspective.

  Project funds will not be used to finance land acquisition/resettlement/compensation costs.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
  in the project area:
  The project neither stimulates negative indirect impacts nor induces future activities in the project
  areas. Benefits and positive impacts will accrue from the improved resiliency of infrastructure and
  the increased capacity of GoSL in managing environmental aspects.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
  impacts.
  Studies for road works will include alternative evaluations as part of the engineering and design
  efforts, to avoid or minimize potentially adverse social and environmental impacts.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
  assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
  Environmental: The PCU has prepared an EMF (January 2014) for the Parent project which
  includes an inventory and preliminary scoping of potential activities and sub-projects as well as
  improved screening procedures to (i) generate standardized Environmental Management Plans
  (EMPs) for relatively simple situations such as new building construction or minor road repairs;
  and (ii) identify conditions where more complex or sensitive environmental conditions exist, such
  as water pipelines or road clearing in forest reserves or other well-preserved ecosystems (e.g.
  Venus – Anse la Raye Road). Such activities would therefore require additional planning and
  management through an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) specific to that subproject. The
  triggering of OP4.09 for Pest Management does not fundamentally alter the subproject portfolio,
  but instead allows flexibility for use or purchase of minor amounts of pesticide (e.g. for termite
  treatment) using licensed professional contractors.The EMF has been updated (February and
  March 2016) to reflect the new AF project suite, and the triggering of the Pest Management
  Policy. Specific EMPs will be developed during implementation, and the Operations Manual will
  reference the EMF and its screening and management procedures.

  The PCU will manage the supervision of environmental compliance through its Project Engineer
  and the Ministry of Infrastructure, Port Services and Transport (MIPST) which is the primary line
  ministry responsible for technical supervision of civil works. The PCU’s capacity to implement
  environmental safeguards is expected to increase with the eventual addition of an environmental
  specialist, at least half-time. Continuous training on environmental safeguards will be provided to
  the MIPS&T as it will be the primary ministry responsible for management and supervision of
  project works. Finally, regional safeguards training workshops have also been recently conducted,
  focusing on practical environmental management for DVRP projects in OECS countries, to
  strengthen ties and enhance practice within the region. A World Bank Environmental Specialist
  will further provide additional technical support with periodic field supervision. Environmental
  Assessments TORs will be forwarded to the Bank for review. EIAs produced will also be
  forwarded to the Bank for review prior to the development of specific works contracts. All works
  contracts requiring an EIA will be subject to prior review and supervision missions will review
  project activities with respect to environmental compliance.

  Social:
  Findings of the social assessment conducted during the preparation of the Parent Project, remain
  valid, given that the activities financed by the AF and EDF grant are similar in nature and extent to


                                            Page 6 of 10
  those under the DVRP. The social benefits of the Project are expected to be positive and will
  remain so under the AF and EDF grant. The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF - January
  2014), developed under the Parent Project will remain relevant with some updates to reflect the
  additional investments which are, in scope and nature, the same as investments under the Parent
  Project. The RPF was updated accordingly in March 2016. Should the development of
  Resettlement Plans become necessary, the RPF will guide the development and implementation of
  Resettlement Action Plans and associated compensatory and mitigation measures. (Project funds
  will not be used for project-induced land acquisition/compensation).

  Social safeguards management will be handled by the PCU, which has experience with the
  Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12) through the implementation of other Bank-financed
  projects. Specifically, the newly hired Social Development Specialist will be in charge of ensuring
  compliance on Social safeguards. In addition, core members of the PCU have also recently
  received capacity building in the implementation of OP 4.12, including a Climate Change
  Coordinator and Communications / Liaison Officer who are also in charge of direct
  communication with communities regarding project activities.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
  on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
  The updated EMF and RPF have been disclosed and subject to public comment, as were the
  original EMF and RPF for the Parent Project. The EMF for the Parent Project was disclosed on
  January 15, 2014 while the updated EMF with AF activities was disclosed on March 17, 2016 .
  Similarly, the original RPF was disclosed on January 15, 2014, while the updated version for the
  AF was disclosed on March 15, 2016.

  The majority of works contemplated involve the repair and retrofitting of existing infrastructure.
  In these cases, impacts to stakeholders will relate to temporary inconveniences, and potential
  permanent or temporary land acquisition and/or resettlement, associated with construction
  activities and will be managed to minimize impacts to the greatest extent possible. Advanced
  public notifications will inform potentially affected persons, who, if necessary, will be
  compensated prior to works. Relevant line ministries and agencies will assist the PCU, the
  Communications Officer and MIPS&T in these efforts.

  When subproject-specific safeguards instruments are required (Environmental Impact
  Assessments (EAs), Social Assessments (SA) or Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs)), specific
  stakeholders will be identified and public meetings will be conducted to enable the reflection of
  stakeholder concerns in project design. These requirements will be incorporated into the TORs for
  EAs and SAs. In the case of land acquisition and/or resettlement, RAPs will be consulted in the
  identification, development, and implementation of the mitigation measures.

"In country" Disclosure

  Comments:
If the project triggers the Pest Management and/or Physical Cultural Resources policies, the
respective issues are to be addressed and disclosed as part of the Environmental Assessment/
Audit/or EMP.
If in-country disclosure of any of the above documents is not expected, please explain why:
The Pest Management Policy has been triggered in case of incidental pesticide use (e.g. termite
treatment for building foundations), as needed. As the quantities will not be significant, no separate
Pest Management Plan has been developed; instead, the updated EMF includes appropriate
procedures in the form of a generic standardized EMP for incorporation into contract clauses.
