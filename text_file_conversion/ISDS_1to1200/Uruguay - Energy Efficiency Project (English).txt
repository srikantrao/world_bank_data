I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):

 The development objective of the Uruguay Energy Efficiency Project is to increase consumer-driven
 demand for, and competitive supply of, energy efficient goods and services. To meet its objective, the
 project will support the Government of Uruguay (GOU) to: (a) create the enabling environment for the
 development of the energy efficiency market; and (b) stimulate the development of the market by
 facilitating the availability and acquisition of energy efficient goods and services.

 The project's global environmental objective is to promote more efficient use of energy through: (a)
 building capacity and know-how among stakeholders; (b) stimulation of consumer-driven demand; and (c)
 promotion of project development and investment financing.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):

The project consists of three main components, each described below:
    1. Energy Efficiency Market Development (implemented by MIEM)
    2. Utility Based Energy Efficiency Services (implemented by UTE)
    3. Project Management (implemented by MIEM and UTE)


  Component 1: Energy Efficiency Market Development (US$10.73 million including US$4.65 million
  GEF). This component, to be implemented by MIEM, aims to support the transformation of the energy
  efficiency market by creating an enabling policy framework, building capacity for energy efficiency
  activities, and establishing a fund to facilitate energy efficiency project development and investment. The
  component will support energy efficiency activities in all economic sectors and will support saving of all
  types of energy. It includes the following activities:

     (1.1) Market Enablement (US$2.825 million including US$ 1.525 million GEF)                    The project
     activities intend to create an enabling environment for energy investment that would include: (a)
     policies and regulations for promoting energy efficiency, including possible creation of a National
     Savings Council; (b) awareness creation and capacity building programs, including a best practice
     program and technical and commercial assessments; (c) a labeling and standards program including a

                                                       2
                                                                                                         ISDS


   voluntary energy efficiency seal for main household appliances, lighting equipment, building thermal
   envelope and industrial equipment; and (d)             standard contractual instruments and financial
   mechanisms to support ESCO-based projects.

   (1.2) Uruguay Fund for Energy Efficiency (UFEE) (US$7.905 million including US$3.125 million
   GEF) This fund would facilitate financing of energy efficiency projects. Project activities would
   include: (a) technical assistance for fund set-up and marketing (US$0.450 GEF); a Project
   Development Facility to cost-share feasibility studies using contingent grants (capitalized with US$1.0
   million); and a Project Finance Facility to finance energy investment projects by emergent ESCOs,
   business and industry (capitalized with US$1.725 million). The UFEE would be managed by a
   commercial bank, on behalf of MIEM.           It would make loans in either US$ or local currency (see
   Annex 5 for details).

Component 2: Utility Based Energy Efficiency Services (US$8.980 million including GEF grant of
US$1.875 million) This component, to be implemented by UTE, would assist the creation and operation
of an Energy Savings Unit within UTE (UTE-ESU). This unit would develop new business activities for
UTE in energy efficiency services, especially demand side management. It would offer services: (a) to
UTE; (b) through UTE to its clients (e.g. financing of efficient equipment through payments on utility
bill); and (c) directly to clients such as businesses. There are three separate sub-components:

   (2.1) Establishment of UTE-ESU (US$1.645 million, including GEF US$0.355 million) This
   component includes: technical assistance to assist in establishing the unit and preparing a business
   plan; staffing, administration and office costs;         market surveys and marketing; training; and
   monitoring and evaluation of activities of the unit.

   (2.2) DSM and Energy Efficiency Investments by UTE-ESU. (US$6.011 million including GEF
   US$1.245 million). These activities would comprise three initial projects that have been defined
   during preparation and further follow-up investments that will be determined during the early years of
   operation. The initial pipeline of projects includes: (a) provision of efficient lights, water heaters and
   other energy efficient equipment to residential and commercial customers in the municipalities of
   Ciudad de la Costa, Paysandú, Colonia del Sacramento and San José de Mayo; (b) installation of new
   municipal lighting equipment in Maldonado, San Jose, Sorriano and Valleja; and (c) reduction of
   losses, and increased end-use efficiency and payment levels in poor urban areas. The business plan of
   the ESU includes US$3.45 million of projects that will be defined during implementation of the
   project, based on the experience in the first projects.

   (2.3) Solar Home Systems (US$1.324 million including GEF US$0.275 million). This will include
   provision of efficient modern energy services to low-income rural customers, using solar home
   systems

Component 3: Project Management. (US$1.2 million including GEF grant of US$0.350 million). This
component would be executed by both MIEM and UTE. MIEM would have overall responsibility for
project management through a Project Management Unit, but would be assisted by UTE, which has
demonstrated experience in the areas of financial management, procurement, disbursement, and reporting,
through previous World Bank projects. It would include: (a) Project Management MIEM (US$0.800
millions including US$0.350 million GEF) and (b) Project Management UTE (US$0.400 million, no
GEF).

                                                   Components:




                                   1. Energy Efficiency Market Development

                                   2. Utility-based Energy Efficiency Services

                                              3. Project Management




I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

The project focuses on increasing energy efficiency and demand-side management nation-wide. Due to this
focus on reducing the impact of ongoing operations on the environment, the impact of the project will be
positive for the environment. By reducing energy requirements and postponing expansion plans for power
plants, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing efficiency, any impact will benefit the
locations, and not harm them.


B. Check Environmental Classification: F (Financial Intermediary Assessment)

Comments:

No adverse environmental effects are expected to result from the project. There would only be
modest interventions in the case of upgrading/retrofitting of energy equipment, which must
comply with local environmental regulations. Positive impacts will include savings in power
generation and fuel use, which would help reduce the risks of global warming by reducing CO2

production. This will happen even in the mostly hydroelectric Uruguayan generation system
because, at the margin, the economic dispatching will reduce the production of electricity by
thermal units that use hydrocarbons.

To be eligible for financing, the subprojects must meet all Uruguayan environmental requirements,
approvals, and procedures, and shall be consistent with the World Bank environmental policies
and procedures, as well as the guidelines of the Bank's Pollution Prevention and Abatement
Handbook.

During project preparation, the project team attested to the adequacy of current Uruguayan
environmental laws and institutions to address potential environmental issues associated with
subprojects to be supported under the project.

The environmental screening procedures will apply to all subprojects financed by the Project. The
project will finance sub-projects to be carried out by UTE (through the ESU) and by project
sponsors that will seek financing from the UFEE. The target investments for financing involve
small to medium sized projects for replacement of old polluting technologies that would fall under
category B and C. Category A sub-projects will not be financed by the Project.

UTE's environmental procedures have been judged adequate by the Bank based on UTE's
experience in implementing the Power Transmission and Distribution project. These procedures
will be used to ensure that UTE-ESU are Category B or C and meet the Bank's environmental
requirements. The commercial bank in charge of UFEE will be required to hire an environmental
consultant (according to the TOR provided in Annex 11) to assess its environmental capacity to
screen subprojects. If then judged necessary, the commercial bank will be required to hire an
environmental consultant (or contract UTE) to establish adequate procedures for environmental
screening and provide capacity.

generation and fuel use, which would help reduce the risks of global warming by reducing CO2
production.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
UTE's environmental capacity has been judged adequate by the Bank based on previous project
experience with UTE (Power Transmission and Distribution project). The commercial bank in
charge of UFEE will be required to hire an environmental consultant (according to the TOR
provided in Annex 11) to assess its environmental capacity to screen subprojects. If then judged
necessary, the commercial bank will be required to hire an environmental consultant (or contract
UTE) to establish adequate procedures for environmental screening and provide needed staffing
resources.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.


 The collaborative nature of the project makes a participatory approach among the participants inherent in
 the planning and execution of its activities. Two workshops on DSM and Energy Efficiency with
 international participation were conducted in Uruguay         for policymakers, regulators, authorities and
 managers of UTE, energy companies, industrial and professional associations, academia, and
 representatives of civil society     A local NGO active in energy issues was consulted during project
 preparation and continues working actively with DINAMA. Consultants with knowledge of regional EE
 initiatives were involved in preliminary project evaluation and continued participating during completion
 of project preparation.
