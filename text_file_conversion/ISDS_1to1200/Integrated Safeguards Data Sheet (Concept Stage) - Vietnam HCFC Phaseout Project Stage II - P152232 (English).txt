                           11. The project development objective is to reduce HCFC consumption in order to contribute to
                           Vietnamâ€™s efforts to meet its 2020 HCFC consumption phase-out obligations under the Montreal
                           Protocol, as well as to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the manufacturing and use of
                           refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment.
                           C. Project Description
                         The proposed Stage II project is a direct continuation of the ongoing Stage I project and the project
                         duration is expected to be from 2017 to 2022. The funding is expected to be approved by the MLF
                         Executive Committee in 2016. The project consists of three proposed components described below.

                         Component 1: HCFC Consumption Reduction
                         AC sector. The project will finance incremental capital costs (ICC) needed for converting to
                         alternative technologies including new production equipment, new AC model performance testing,
                         and training for installing and servicing technicians, and incremental operating cost (IOC) based on
                         MLF financing guidelines at four enterprises which are eligible for MLF and consumed 176 MT of
                         HCFC-22 in 2014. After completion of conversion at the four enterprises, no HCFC-22 should be
                         used for AC production in the whole sector, i.e. about 251 MT of HCFC-22 presently used. The
                         estimated investment funding is about US$2 million. The potential low GWP alternatives to
                         HCFC-22 in the AC sector are HFC-32 with a GWP 675 or R-290 with a GWP of 5, however both
                         are flammable. In addition, EE financing will be explored during project preparation for supporting
                         the uptake of non-HCFC more energy efficient AC (such as EE regulations and awareness, energy
                         star labelling, technical assistance, demand-side initiatives, etc.).

                         Refrigeration sector. There is no single refrigerant which can replace HCFC-22, making the HCFC
                         phase-out in the refrigerant sector very challenging. The project will finance conversion of priority
                         industrial refrigerating systems where cost-effective and low GWP alternatives (e.g. ammonia,
                         hydrocarbons, HFC-32 etc.) are available, by providing ICC (system, component and process
                         redesign, new equipment, performance verification, safety training, etc.) and IOC for conversion at
                         about 30 enterprises which are eligible for MLF funding . The estimated cost to the project is about
                         US$ 1.5 million. In addition, EE financing for refrigeration manufacturing in conjunction with the
                         Vietnam Energy Efficiency Financing for Industrial Enterprises project (EE in end users) will be
                         explored during project preparation to offset the climate impacts of interim alternatives with high
                         GWP that may have to be used if low GWP alternatives are not yet available.

                         Servicing sector. The project will finance the following activities: training and certification in good
                         servicing and maintenance practices, provision of servicing tools to selected vocational training
                         centers to enable training in the handling of alternative flammable refrigerants, technical assistance
                         demonstration for 10 selected industrial refrigeration end users on HCFC leakage management, and
                         bilateral TA from Japan Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) for using HFC-32 in the
                         AC sector. The estimated cost for these activities is US$1.7 million for a HCFC-22 phase-out impact
                         of 352 MT.

                         Foam sector. The project will finance ICC needed for foam production conversion to hydrocarbon,
                         methyl formate or HFO (hydrofluoroolefin) alternatives at about 40 enterprises eligible for funding.
                         In order to allow SMEs (consuming HCFC-141 less than 20MT) to convert to non-HCFC production
                         in a cost-effective way, the project will also finance upgrading of two or three system houses to be
                         competitively selected among existing foam producers or chemical suppliers that have established
                         the basic system house infrastructure. These system houses would supply non-HCFC pre-blended
                         polyol to SMEs. In addition, the project will finance conversion at an enterprise which uses
                         HCFC-22 for XPS foam production. The estimated investment funding request from MLF for the
                         sector is about US$6.6 million.

                         Component 2: Technical Assistance and Policy Actions
                         This component aims to support sector-wide technology and knowledge transfer, TA and exchange
                         of best practices, as well as to create a policy and market environment that will enable and sustain
                         sector transformation. TA activities focused on the refrigeration and AC manufacturing sectors will
                         include training workshops on sub-projects preparation, international and national technical

                         consultant services, development of technical standards of alternatives, training for government
                         officials, training on safe use of alternatives, study tours on HCFC alternatives, a joint study on
                         integrating HCFC phase-out and EE improvement in the industrial refrigeration manufacturing and
                         food process sectors, TA on foaming formulation using non-HCFC pre-blended polyol for the system
                         houses, and others as needed. TA for the servicing sector is included in Component 1 as it results in
                         HCFC phase-out impact.

                         On policies, this component will cover the annual HCFC import quota issuance and the development
                         and issuance of sector-specific policy and regulations by project completion, including bans on local
                         production and import of HCFC-22 based ACs, ban on import and use of pre-blended HCFC-141b
                         polyol in foam production, and ban on installation of selected out-of-date HCFC-22 refrigeration
                         applications.

                         Component 3: Project Management
                         It is proposed that the PMU currently implementing the Stage I HCFC Phase-out Project continues in
                         this new project, including financial, procurement, and safeguard management as well as monitoring
                         and reporting. However, MONRE will formally announce establishment of the PMU for the Stage II
                         project. This component will finance hiring of PMU staff, project launch and completion workshops,
                         financial audits, annual HCFC consumption verification, public awareness activities, and incremental
                         operating cost.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The project may involve HCFC conversion at about 80 enterprises in air-conditioning, refrigeration,
                         and foam manufacturing sectors around the country. A long list of potential participating beneficiary
                         enterprises in these sectors will be determined during project preparation. The final list of beneficiary

                         enterprises will only be confirmed during the project implementation when preparing and appraising
                         sub-projects by the PMU. Ammonia, HFC-32 and hydrocarbons, which are flammable materials, are
                         the main alternatives to be adopted by the project. This could lead to safety issues for which proper
                         safety equipment and training should be put in place.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         Department of Meteorology, Hydrology and Climate Change in MONRE hosts the National Ozone
                         Office (NOO) which acts as the focal point for MP implementation. The Stage I HCFC Phase-out
                         Project employs a project management unit (PMU), which works directly with the NOO and has
                         been facilitating and coordinating preparation of this Stage II HCFC project. It is expected that the
                         PMU currently implementing the Stage I HCFC Phase-out Project would continue in the new project,
                         including safeguard management, monitoring and reporting, but MONRE will formally name the
                         PMU. MONRE and the PMU are experienced with safeguard issues under the HCFC Stage I project.

                         Participating enterprises are also under supervision of the Department of Natural Resources and
                         Environment in each province, the Ministry/Department of Industry and Trade (for safe chemical use
                         and chemical import) and the Industrial Zone Management Board for those located in the industrial
                         zones or clusters.
