    D. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
    (if known)
    Activities financed are not location-specific as this operation will support upstream work through
    technical assistance. Positive benefits are expected due to increased awareness and knowledge of
    MEINR staff and other relevant counterparts on addressing sustainable mining aspects into national
    policy tools which will be applied countrywide.
    E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
    The project PIU has long standing experience with World Bank Projects and associated Safeguards
    Requirements. Capacity Building on International Social and Environmental Standards for The
    Interministerial Mineral sector Policy development Comission and Multi Stakeholder Group is an
    integrated part of the project design.
