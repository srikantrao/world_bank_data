B.  Project Objectives 
 
The objective of the proposed Project is to support the most crucial components of the Government's 
SWM program, and if implemented will benefit all citizens of Tehran, by developing a new 
environmentally and socially safe disposal site for solid waste, and improving the transfer system for 
solid waste. In parallel, the project will also strengthen the technical and institutional capacity for SWM 
system in Tehran by adopting a strategic plan for improving SWM. Accordingly development objectives 
for the proposed project can be summarized as follows: 
a) 
Improving integrated SWM in Tehran; and 
b) 
Developing environmentally and socially safe disposal for solid waste 
 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
The scope of the project involves an integrated approach for SWM in the Greater Tehran area. The total 
costs for the project are estimated at US$100-150 million (US$70-105 million IBRD Loan and US$30-45 
million Government contribution). A summary of the initially identified project components is as follows: 
 
Component A:  Institutional Strengthening including Pilot Recycling Projects
 
The institutional arrangements for SWM in the Municipality of Tehran will be reinforced to encourage 
the ongoing transition towards reduction-reuse-recycling (3Rs) strategy and greater private sector 
participation in service delivery.  The institutional strengthening will focus on: 
 
\01fi
Integrated waste management, with priority on a 3Rs Strategy

\01fi
Sustainable financing for solid waste 
\01fi
Pilot projects for testing strategic objectives 
\01fi
Participatory mechanisms to support strategic objectives 
\01fi
Training in environmental monitoring and enforcement  
\01fi
Long-term action planning (2010-2015)   
 
Component B:  New Solid Waste Landfill 
 
The new sanitary landfill will be constructed to meet modern controlled landfill environmental protection 
objectives for general municipal solid wastes. Additional separate landfill cells for hospital wastes are 
also planned.  
 
\01fi
New sanitary landfill and related mobile equipment 
\01fi
Transfer equipment and related facilities 
\01fi
Healthcare waste management landfill cells (pilot scale) 
\01fi
Healthcare waste and essential related equipment (pilot scale) 
 
 
D.  Project location 
 
The general project location is the Municipality of Tehran and the adjacent region within approximately 
100 km. A new landfill site will be located within the project location, and the site selection process is 
incorporated in the Environmental Assessment report under preparation.  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
The Borrower has a project management team, as well as a group of expert advisers from technical and 
academic institutions to assist in the project preparation studies. The Borrower will closely supervise the 
quality of the EA Report, which is being carried out by an independent institute. Furthermore, the 
Borrower will also liaison with the Department of Environment who already has its own EA guidelines 
for landfills. There is thus strong capacity of the Borrower to meet Safeguard requirements.  
 
A separate Social Assessment Report is also under preparation by the Borrower.
