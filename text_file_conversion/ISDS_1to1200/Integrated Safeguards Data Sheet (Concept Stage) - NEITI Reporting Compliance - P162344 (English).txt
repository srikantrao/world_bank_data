                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The project development objective is to assist Nigeria in meeting the EITI requirement for data
                           timeliness.
                           C. Project Description
                           EITI implementation in Nigeria has been supported by the EITI-MDTF with three grants to date.
                           The first MDTF grant was US$1.2 million and provided support to establish NEITI. The support
                           from the grant led, amongst others, to the passage of the NEITI Act in 2007. A second grant was US
                           $900,000, completed in March 2012, and contributed to Nigeria➢❨ s validation as an EITI-compliant
                           country. The grant also helped NEITI to expand coverage to the solid minerals sector.

                           The third grant closed in December 2015 and was partially satisfactory. The grant amount was
                           originally US$900,000 and later increased to US$1,280,000. However, NEITI had to cancel US
                           $500,564.47 when the EITI-MDTF closed on December 31, 2015. Two incomplete activities were
                           pilot remediation projects for taking corrective actions on problems identified in oil and gas reports,
                           and automation of data collection in the petroleum sector to help speed up production of NEITI
                           reports. Both were due to unsatisfactory performance of the contractors hired to perform the tasks.

                           NEITI and the World Bank had been discussing options for a data platform to collect data and carry
                           out basic analysis for reconciliation of payments and revenues for the oil and gas reports, when the
                           discussion was overtaken by the fiscal crisis in Nigeria, which became increasingly serious in the
                           latter half of 2016. The situation was considered sufficiently serious that the International Secretariat

                           for EITI approached the World Bank to find out if the World Bank➢❨ s next engagement phase
                           could be redirected to help with publication of the 2014 NEITI reports, and get a timely start on the
                           2015 oil and gas report.
