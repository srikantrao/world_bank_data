                           The Project Development Objectives (PDO) are to support Honduras (i) to improve the capacities of
                           national and local actors in violence prevention, (ii) to ensure urban municipalities are addressing
                           crime and violence risk factors, and (iii) to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible
                           emergency. It aims to achieve objective (i) through greater capacity of national institutions to
                           coordinate violence prevention interventions, and to diagnose the sources and dynamics of violence.
                           It aims to achieve objective (ii) through improved capacity to design municipal violence prevention
                           plans and interventions that are evidence-informed, and invest in integrated approaches that address

                         the multiple risk factors contributing to specific types of violence, particularly intra-family and
                         gender-based, school-based, and community-based violence. In addition, objective (iii) will be
                         achieved through the Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM) that enables IDA countries to have fast

                         access to financial resources including part of the undisbursed balance of their investment lending
                         portfolio in the event of a crisis or emergency.

                         As agreed with the Government, to achieve the second part of the PDO, the project will focus
                         initially on three municipalities in the Northern region (La Ceiba, Choloma, and El Progreso). This
                         reflects the prioritization done within the Safer Municipalities Program which puts a premium in
                         areas with high concentrations of crime and violence. For this Project, municipalities were selected
                         by ranking in decreasing order those with an urban population lower than 250,000 inhabitants and
                         with a homicide rate higher than 90 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, which is about the national
                         average. In addition, the team verified that there were propitious conditions in those municipalities in
                         terms of engagement and commitment with citizen security . Additional municipalities may be
                         considered during project implementation if agreed between the Government and the Bank based on
                         the municipal participation criteria described in the Operations Manual.

                         3. Project Description
                         This project consists of three components. The restructuring only changes the amount allocated to
                         each component, but not the structure of the project.

                         Component 1: Institutional strengthening of national-level violence prevention institutions (approx.
                         US$1.75 million revised- previously US$2million).
                         This component would provide technical assistance and some equipment to:


                                                                       Page 2 of 8
                         1.1 Strengthen the Violence Prevention National Vice-Ministry (SEDS in Spanish)'s capacity to
                         guide, coordinate, and oversee violence prevention activities in selected communities.
                         1.2 Strengthen the capacity of SEDS and three selected municipalities to collect and process violence

                         data for evidence-based policymaking.

                         Component 2: Integrated Crime and Violence Prevention at Municipal and Community Level
                         (approx. US$7.22 revised- previously US$11 million).
                         This component would strengthen the capacity of selected municipalities to:
                         2.1 Design, plan and implement integrated crime and violence prevention plans, policies, and
                         ordinances.
                         2.2 Promote collective efficacy.
                         2.3 Manage grants for the implementation of municipal sub-projects in at least three "hotspot"
                         neighborhoods in each targeted municipality as well as other strategic initiatives with a municipal
                         wide-scope. Sub-projects include social prevention interventions, situational prevention
                         interventions, access to basic services and alternative conflict resolution measures.

                         Component 3: Project Administration and M&E (approx. US$2.38 revised- previously US$2
                         million).
                         This component seeks to:
                         3.1 Support project management through project staffing and management costs for the PIU in FHIS-
                         IDECOAS
                         3.2 Support the development and implementation of a system for monitoring and evaluation.

                         Component 4: IRM contingent (US$0 unchanged)
                         This component includes the provision of support to respond to an eligible emergency.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         This project would be implemented in three municipalities that have different socio-environmental
Public Disclosure Copy




                         characteristics but that meet the following criteria: high homicide rates, high poverty levels, and
                         located in urban areas. Because the subprojects included in the infrastructure investment component
                         (basic services) of the Project will focus in urban areas, the potential environmental and social
                         negative impacts are minor and the measures are easy to identify and implement during the
                         subprojects execution. One of the municipalities, La Ceiba, has two small traditional Garifuna
                         communities, Corozal and Sambo Creek. These communities do not meet the eligibility criteria but
                         the project will include them in the benefits of project activities and investments as they are highly
                         vulnerable due to their geographical location and socio-economic status.

                                                        financed by the Project. For example, these communities
                                                        could benefit from activities that focus on increasing

                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                               In regards of the environment, the subprojects that potentially will be financed with the
                              restructuring project are minor works where the negative impacts will be moderate to low
                              significance, and the measures to prevent, mitigate and / or compensate potential the negative
                              impacts are easy to identify and implement.

                             According with the EMF and the national law, if the subproject is classified as ➢❨ 1➢❨ (low
                             negative impacts), the subproject will require the application of the Form No. 1 (Formulario
                             SINEA F-01) and apply the Code of Good Environmental Practices of Honduras developed by the
                             national environmental authority (CÃ³digo de Buenas PrÃ¡cticas Ambientales de Honduras ➢❨
                             CBPAH); if the subproject is classified as ➢❨ 2➢❨ (moderate negative impacts), the subproject
                             will require the application of the Form No. 2 (Formulario SINEA F-02) and will require the
                             preparation of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), in order to comply with the national
Public Disclosure Copy




                             law and the Bank➢❨ s Environmental Assessment Policy (OP/BP 4.01).
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                               It is not expected to have any indirect or long-term negative impact.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                               The overall social impact of the Project is expected to be positive and therefore no project
                              alternatives were considered.
                              The subproject alternatives will be considered in the design of the subprojects at implementation
                              stage.
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                              assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                               FHIS-IDECOAS has prior experience in the Barrio Ciudad Project and the current Project with
                              the Bank's social and environmental safeguard policies and has actively engaged technical
                              assistance in order to comply with the safeguard policies during project implementation. The EMF
                              of the Project was recently updated (June 2016) in order to include lessons learned and to update
                              information and new instruments included in the new environmental law as table of categorization.
                              During the current project implementation, the EMF was properly implemented by the UAP and
                              specifically by the environmental specialist.


                                                                        Page 5 of 8
                           According to the last safeguard mission (April 2016), all the subprojects of the third package (20
                           subprojects) have their respective Environmental Inspection Forms (SINEIA F-01 and F-02), the
Public Disclosure Copy




                           Environmental Categorization Forms (FCA) required by the environmental authority, and the
                           Environmental and Social Preliminary Assessment Form (FESAP) included in the EMF. Five (5)
                           of the Twenty (20) subprojects were classified as "B" or ➢❨ 2➢❨ according with the national law
                           (Moderate environmental impact) and developed their EMP which were approved by the
                           environmental authority (MIAMBIENTE). Fifteen (15) subprojects were classified as "C" or
                           ➢❨ 1➢❨ according with the national law (Low environmental risk).

                           The UAP also includes a social specialist who has assisted with the inputs for the Resettlement
                           Policy Framework and the Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework. The Bank➢❨ s Safeguards
                           team provided specific training during the current Project implementation in order to assure the
                           application of the safeguard instruments. Good practices were identified such as the the
                           modification of the design of bus stops to prevent adverse consequences in terms of loss of
                           economic revenue for street vendors, or improvement of access to community roads for physically
                           challenged persons. In the municipality of Choloma, only one of the sub-projects will require the
                           application of an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan. The rating the project was satisfactory and the
                           impact was low in terms of Social Safeguards.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                             The EMF was socialized during the preparation phase of the current Project at the internal level
                           (FHIS-IDECOAS) and external level (local authorities). Due to the restructuring, the EMF will
                           only include minor changes, mainly to update information related to the national law. The
                           instrument will not require to be disclosed again.

                           The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) must be updated to include specific action steps and
                           procedures to follow so as to develop an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan. Currently, only one of

                           the sub-projects requires an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan. The RFP will be updated and
                           socialized with the municipalities, technical staff, and stakeholders before the beginning of works.
                           It will then be published.

                           During the preparation phase of the Project, the Garifuna communities eligible to be part of the
                           project were consulted on Oct 15, 2012 in compliance with the Indigenous Peoples Planning
                           Framework. They were fully informed regarding the Project and the provision related to the
                           Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework. The final version of the Indigenous Peoples Planning
                           Framework was disclosed on the FHIS website and Infoshop on Oct 23, 2012 prior to the appraisal
                           mission. However, the final selection of communities as agreed with the counterpart did not
                           include these Garifuna communities. In the communities beneficiaries of the Project, a few
                           members of Garifuna communities have been identified and are included as beneficiaries of the
                           interventions of the Project. The Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework will not be modified.
