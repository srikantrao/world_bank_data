B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The proposed Payment System and Bank Modernization 1.2  (PSMB 1.2) Project would expand the scope of the 
first Payment System and Bank Modernization Project (PSBM 1)by: (i) increasing the number of Inter-Bank 
Payment System (IBPS) processing centers throughout the country so that it can continue operating in a fast, reliable 
and safe manner; and (ii) accelerate the roll out of the new core banking systems to a substantial number of 
commercial bank branches in the next two to three years. This will minimize the possible operational problems and 
costs of running two different systems in parallel through their branch networks. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
Given the objectives mentioned above and the type of work envisioned, the expansion will be an “Investment 
Operation” and it is being prepared under the new World Bank procedures for processing “repeater projects.  
Repeater projects are those whose basic design and effectives has been proven, and which a borrower proposes to 
augment and scale up.  The purpose of such operation could be to raise the quantity of the output, extend the 
geographical scope of the output to cover additional areas or individuals in a country, or add components over an 
extended time horizon.”   
 
The project will have two major components: (i) the expansion of the IBPS at the State Bank of Vietnam;  and  (ii) 
the roll out of the new core banking systems at the following  five Commercial Banks (CBs):  Vietnam Bank for 
Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD); Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV), 
Industrial and Commercial Bank of Vietnam (ICB); Vietnam Maritime Commercial Stock Bank (Maritime) and 
Vietnam Export – Import Bank (Eximbank). 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
There is no specific project location. This is a Country wide program as was the  PSBM 1.  New IBPS processing 
centers (PPCs) will be added in at least 5 to7 SBV Provincial Branches and the new core banking systems will be 
rolled out to a substantial number of CBs branches throughout the Country.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The project will be implemented by the SBV and the five CBs that will participate in the project in the same manner 
than the first PSBM 1.  Overall management of the project is entrusted to the Informatics Technology Department of 
the State Bank of Vietnam (ITDB), which is acted as the Project Management Unit (PMU). The ITDB is specifically 
responsible for implementing the National Inter-bank Payment Clearing and Settlement System component of the 
Project. In addition, ITDB will supervise the implementation of the Commercial Bank Core Banking System 
component, which is implemented at 5 CBs, namely BIDV, VBARD, ICB, Maritime and Eximbank. The existing 
project implementing unit (PIU) at each of the 5 CBs will be responsible for implementing the Core Banking System 
of their own.
