B.  Project Objectives  
 
The principal objective of the Project is to improve access to quality emergency services in 
selected health facilities to serve the urgent needs of the Iraqi population.  This objective would 
be achieved through: (i) rehabilitation of priority emergency services, including emergency 
obstetric care in 10 selected hospitals, (ii) the urgent provision of basic medical and laboratory 
equipment to the selected rehabilitated hospitals, (iii) the procurement and distribution of a 3 to 6 
month supply of up to 30 essential emergency medicines to be used at emergency facilities 
rehabilitated through this project; (iv) continued support to strengthening of planning and 
management capacity within the central and provincial health administrations; and (v) support to 
project management.  By the end of this project it is expected that: 
 
·
Ten carefully selected hospitals will have functioning emergency medical services 
defined by adequate physical infrastructure, essential equipment and drugs, adequate 
staffing and well trained emergency teams. 
 
·
The Ministry of Health will have strengthened its planning and management capacity at 
both central and regional levels.  
 
·
These two groups of outcomes can be assessed by the definition of simple quantifiable 
indicators that will be agreed upon at negotiations.

C.  Project Description 
 
The Project would comprise five components, to be implemented over a period of up to 18 
months.  It will be fully funded as a Grant under the Iraq Trust Fund, operating under OP 8.50, 
Emergency Recovery Assistance.  The five components are described below: 
 
Component 1:  Rehabilitation of priority emergency services in 10 hospitals  
(estimated total 
cost US$ 15.0 million) 
 
Priority hospital services, such as Emergency Units, Emergency Obstetric Services, Critical Care 
Services (operation departments, ICU, CCU, acute radiology, etc) and Support Services (central 
sterilization departments, laboratories, etc) will be partly or fully rehabilitated and equipped in 
10 carefully selected hospitals.  Criteria for selection will be determined at a later date by MoH, 
in conjunction with PAC, WB and other funding agencies.  Criteria should take into 
consideration:: (i) size of population served; (ii) possible duplication with other donors; (iii) 
existence of other similar medical services within the catchment area; (iv) accessibility for 
patients and emergency vehicles; (v) utilization; (vi) staff size; (vii) age of facility; (viii) size of 
facility and land; (ix) preliminary cost estimates for rehabilitation; and (x) justification for 
rehabilitation vs. reconstruction. 
 
To date, the MoH has conducted a self-administered facility-needs survey (for hospitals, primary 
health care centers and sub centers), collecting the following essential data needed in all 18 
Governorates:  1) physical structures of all health facilities; 2) accessibility and extent of 
catchments areas; 3) needs for expansion and rehabilitation; 4) human resources needs; 5) 
individual needs of each facility; and 6) functionality of each facility. Collection of this 
information has been completed.  As soon as this data is made available, the MoH can use this 
tool to identify rehabilitation priorities for emergency services at hospitals and select the neediest 
facilities throughout the country to be rehabilitated.  Amount of funding for each selected facility 
will be determined based on each facilities needs, assuming that some facilities will need more 
rehabilitation than others. 
 
This first phase of the reconstruction effort will concentrate on establishment of a sustainable 
model for planning, procurement and financial management. It will allow the development of 
standards for health facilities and will constitute the most effective way for the MOH to acquire 
the capacity it needs to manage longer-term reconstruction/rehabilitation activities. 
 
Component 2: Provision and distribution of emergency medical services equipment in 10 
rehabilitated hospitals 
(estimated total cost US$ 3.0 million) 
 
To the extent possible, hospitals undergoing rehabilitation will not have to be closed, and basic 
emergency diagnostic and treatment equipment and simple furniture will be supplied as soon as 
possible to these emergency facilities. To avoid unnecessary delays, there will be no need to 
complete a detailed inventory of existing equipment. The MOH will agree upon the minimum 
equipment requirements and will define standard emergency care kits, including emergency 
obstetric care, which will greatly simplify both procurement and distribution.

Component 3:  Provision and distribution of essential emergency drugs
 
(estimated total cost 
US$ 5.0 million) 
 
The Emergency Health Reconstruction Project will support the procurement and distribution of a 
3
to 6 month supply of up to 30 essential emergency medicines to be used at emergency facilities 
rehabilitated through this project, with particular attention on emergency obstetric drugs.  The 
MoH will select the essential emergency drugs currently included in leading pharmaceutical 
formularies, which could comprise, but are not limited to, the following: (i) general anesthetics 
and oxygen; (ii) preoperative medication and sedatives; (iii) anti-infective drugs; (iv) blood 
products and plasma substitutes; (v) cardiovascular drugs; (vi) oxytocics and anti-oxytocics; and 
(vii) oral and parenteral solutions.  The project will also provide support to the MoH in 
developing a sustainable plan for procurement and distribution of essential emergency drugs.   
 
Component 4: Capacity-building and training of MoH staff 
(estimated total cost US$ 1.0 
million) 
 
The Emergency Health Reconstruction Project will continue to support on-going technical 
assistance in the areas of facilities-based master planning, National Health Accounts, project 
management, financial management and procurement, much of which began in May 2004.  
Additional training will be provided in Emergency Medical Services and will focus on the 
development of a comprehensive national plan for strengthening emergency health care services. 
A
combination of short and long-term training programs, as well as limited physical 
rehabilitation of existing training institutions, will allow for the constitution of a core group of 
public health and health management specialists.  The initial training will lead to the possibility 
in Phase II of helping set up the first Iraqi School of Public Health and Health Management 
1
.
Component 5: Project Management 
(estimated total cost US$ 1.0 million):
 
Project management support will cover the investment and operating costs of the Project 
Management Team (PMT), including the provision of furniture, equipment, technical assistance 
and training necessary for the management of the project activities.  Salary costs of the PMT, 
with the exception of consultants, will be covered by the MoH’s recurrent budget. 
 
D.  Project location 
 
Project location will be determined according to the facilities list proposed by the MoH which 
meets the selection criteria for selecting facilities eligible for rehabilitation.   
 
1
There are no internationally accredited schools of public health in the MENA region. Institutions  that provide 
some PH training exist however in Egypt, Tunisia, Iran and Jordan, but none of these offer the range or the quality 
of training available in Europe or in the US.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The borrower’s institutional capacity will be assessed during the upcoming mission in October 
2004.  The training on environment will be provided if needed, and the training program will be 
integrated into project design.
