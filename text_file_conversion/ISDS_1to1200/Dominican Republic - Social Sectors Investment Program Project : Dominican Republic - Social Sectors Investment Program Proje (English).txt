B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN]

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
1.  Improve Social Protection Services through institutional capacity-building of the Unified 
System for Beneficiary Selection (SIUBEN) and two conditional cash transfers programs which 
use the SIUBEN, and strengthen monitoring and evaluation capabilities of both government and 
civil society for social protection programs;  
 
2.
Improve access to social protection through Documentation, by ensuring that (i) every single 
child born in the Dominican Republic receives a birth certificate and (ii) undocumented children 
and adults of all ages are able to obtain their birth certificates and/or national identity cards.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
It is expected that the Social Cabinet will coordinate project execution through its soon-to-be 
created Department of Administration and Finance.  A subordinate Project Execution Unit would 
be established in the National Civil Registry.  Preliminary assessment of existing capacity 
suggests the need to strengthen both financial management and procurement capabilities with 
additional staff and training.
