                           The PDO is to improve treasury management and expenditure control through modernization of the cash planning and
                           allocations management.

                           C. Project Description
                           The project aims to support cash management reform actions presented in the Government’s PFM Reform
                           Program 2016-2020. The proposed project is focused on the following areas: (i) strengthening of the legal
                           and regulatory framework for cash planning and management; (ii) implementation of an effective and
                           efficient ICT integrated module for cash planning in the treasury system and linking it with two existing
                           modules for budget appropriations and budget allocations; and (iii) capacity building of finance officers (in
                           MoF and other Budgetary Institutions). Some foundation for this activity was laid by IMF advice and GIZ TA

                                  Strengthening cash planning and execution




                           aimed at linking multiyear budgeting with multiyear commitments and budget execution in the treasury
                           system.

                           The project will be implemented through two components as follows.

                           Component 1: Strengthening of legal and regulatory framework for cash planning and management. This
                           project component consists of targeted technical assistance and capacity building activities as follows:

                                 1. An initial assessment of current practice applied in Kosovo for cash and allocations management
                                    including a review of current legal framework and IT infrastructure used;
                                 2. identification of countries that have similar budget cycle and infrastructure and proven records of
                                    sound practices in cash and allocation management;
                                 3. development of new legal and regulatory framework and technical specification for the IT solution to

                                    be used; and
                                 4. delivery of several trainings from consultants and trainers from Treasury to all 120 budget
                                    organizations on the new regulatory framework.

                           This component will be delivered through a combination of study visits, engaging consultants, training and
                           other knowledge sharing events. The training activity will be combined with training on the use of the new
                           proposed integrated module in the following component, and may be based on a ToT approach.

                           Component 2: Implement an integrated module within KFMIS for cash planning and budget allocations.
                           This Project component will support the development and implementation a specific module within KFMIS
                           and interlink it with two existing modules for budget appropriations and budget allocations. Such module will
                           be used by all users (around 2000) responsible for cash flow planning and will enable the Treasury to
                           generate consolidated cash flow forecasts and at the same time increase control of budget allocations within
                           KFMIS. The module will be developed according to technical specifications that will be prepared as an
                           outcome of Component 1. It is envisaged that this activity will be procured directly (single source) from
                           KFMIS’s service provider. The activity envisages both the technical roll out of the module and focused
                           training activities provided to budget organizations on the use of the module.

                           Project Cost and Financing. The activity will be financed by SAFE Trust Fund. In addition, the recipient
                           organization shall provide co-financing for the investment under component 2, as well as in-kind
