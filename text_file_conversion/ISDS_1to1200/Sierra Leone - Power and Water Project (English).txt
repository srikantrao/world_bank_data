A.2. Project Objectives
The project's development objective is to improve sustainable access to essential power, rural
water supply and sanitation, and urban solid waste management services.

The following outcomes will be sought:
     · Power: Power: Residents of Western Freetown will have stable and a platform for
          adequate power supplies (including the 50 MW Bumbuna hydroelectric project, which is
          expected to be commissioned in late 2006), while over the long term, a national power
          grid will provide electricity to more people in a more efficient and cost effective way,
          boosting economic and social development capacity with widespread, reliable and
          affordable electrical power. The Project will also ensure the sustained financial viability
          of the NPA, while establishing a sector management and regulatory framework,
          conducive to private, strategic partners' participation in the future development of the
          power sector;
     · RWS: Rural residents in targeted Districts will have clean drinking water and adequate
          rural sanitation facilities, contributing to improved health; and
     · SWM: Freetown residents will have a reliable, sustainable, affordable, socially
          acceptable and environmentally safe solid waste collection and disposal system, leading
          to improved general health and living conditions.
UWS: The urban water supply utility, GVWC, will be managed in a more commercially-oriented
way, and will improve the quality of service it provides to Freetown's water consumers.
A.3. Project Description

In support of these objectives, the proposed Power and Water Project is estimated to cost about US$35
million, with the following components:

Section II ­ Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

For the water component:

Environmental Assessment

         Erosion: The construction of boreholes, pumping stations, pipelines and storage tanks
can result in erosion and loss of vegetation. Measures to mitigate these impacts must be included
into construction contracts.

         Wastewater:       The main impact of water supply systems is the wastewater that is
generated, which will produce muddy pathways and standing pools of water where mosquitoes
breed, if not disposed of properly. Design and construction contracts must provide for wastewater
disposal at all piped water outlets. Procedures to govern private operator(s) handling of such
environmental issues will be included in their contracts. Provision would also have to be made for
waste disposal at water treatment sites.

       Solid Waste Management: Impact is expected to be positive in terms of healthier and
cleaner environment. Equipment for refuse collection, assistance to prepare a solid waste
collection program for Freetown, and also preparation studies for a waste management plan will
be funded under this component. A Solid Waste Management Plan outlines the planning tools fro
a system of solid waste collection and management in Freetown.

      Environmental and Social Management Framework: This ESMF will provide the
appropriate tools for carrying out environmental assessments and analysis in relation to wells and
boreholes, and the construction of latrines and spring boxes. It also provides guidance and
screening mechanisms for how to identify impacts which may cause other safeguard policies to
be triggered.

Resettlement: A small amount of land is likely to be needed for boreholes, pumping stations,
storage tanks and communal water points. Construction of these facilities as well as pipelines can
result in temporary or permanent loss of land, crops and other means of income generation. A


*By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties'
claims on the disputed areas

Resettlement Policy Framework will be prepared prior to appraisal. The framework will spell out
how the Resettlement Action Plan will be completed prior to the beginning of activities. A
Resettlement Policy Framework is a description of how to prepare and implement resettlement
action    plans    when     an    impact      on    people     and   property    has     been      identified.

Water Resources: Nearly all sub-projects will be based on groundwater and spring water. There is
no international water involved in this project. During sub-project preparation, the safe yield and
potential drawdown of water levels in the vicinity of the boreholes will be checked to confirm
that the proposed water source is sustainable and will not adversely affect nearby wells. Excreta
disposal facilities will need to be set back from water sources. If surface sources are developed,
the sustainability of the proposed abstraction and the impact of withdrawals on downstream
beneficial uses will be assessed.

Cultural Property: There is a remote chance that cultural artifacts may be discovered during the
excavation of pipe trenches and foundations. An Environmental and Social management
Framework (ESMF) has been prepared and will specify actions that contractors must take when a
possible cultural artifacts are unearthed.

Safety of Dams: The ESMF mentioned above also set out the procedures which must be followed
if a participating town intends to draw water from a reservoir controlled by an existing or new
dam.

For the Power component:

Power sector reform/capacity building/institutional strengthening: These components are not
expected to have any negative impact on the bio-physical or human environment.

Infrastructure: The improvements to be installed at the Kingtom Power Plant will require an
environmental impact assessment including a waste/sludge disposal action plan. The
rehabilitation and reinforcement of the transmission and distribution network of the Western Area
will also require an environmental impact assessment as well as a resettlement policy framework.
Because the towers of the 33 kV transmission line already exist, a resettlement action plan is
required to address resettlement and compensation issues related to its completion.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area.
N/A
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
N/A
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The required safeguard documentation, relevant to each safeguard policy is being prepared. The Project
Implementation Units (PIUs) will be staffed with environmental and social development (resettlement)
specialists.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Adversely affected people are part of the preparation of the RAP. The frame works include the appropriate
mechanism for consultation and participation. The EIAs also include stakeholder information and
consultation principles.
The key stakeholders are members of the local community which will be affected negatively and positively.
Others are those in water and power utilities, ministries and other members of civic society.
