                           The proposed Project Development Objective is to assist the Municipality of Fortaleza in enhancing
                           the quality of its urban environment through integrated infrastructure investments in priority areas,
                           and strengthening its urban planning and management capacity.
                         C. Project Description
                         The Project will have three components:
                         Component 1. Urban and Environmental Restoration. This component will support: (i) the

                         optimization of existing sanitation infrastructure in the Vertente MarÃ-tima watershed, including
                         financing household connections, to improve the water quality in the city➢❨ s seashore; (ii) the
                         environmental restoration and urban renewal of the Park Rachel de Queiroz, including the
                         implementation of an Urban Operation in the area; and (iii) promote a comprehensive approach for
                         solid waste management.
                         Component 2. Strengthening Municipal Management Capacity for Urban Planning, Disaster Risk
                         Management (DRM) and Environmental Management. This component will support: (i) a better
                         integration of DRM and resilience activities into the city➢❨ s urban planning and management
                         process; (ii) the development of an integrated multipurpose cadaster; (iii) the implementation of
                         SEUMA➢❨ s ➢❨ Fortaleza Online Program➢❨ , aiming at expanding the current online system of
                         services; (iv) the identification and structuring of Urban Operations; (v) the review of the Master
                         Plan and Land Use and Zoning Law; and (vi) the strengthening of SEUMA➢❨ s urban and
                         environmental monitoring systems.
                         Component 3. Project Management. This component will support the technical and fiduciary
                         management of the project, project audits, and project monitoring and evaluation.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Fortaleza is the fifth largest city in the country with a population of 2.6 million inhabitants (IBGE,
                         2014), who live in a territory of 314.93 square kilometers (population density equals 8.3 thousand
                         inhabitants/km2). The city➢❨ s Gini coefficient is one of the highest amongst state capitals (IBGE,
                         2010) and 5.46 percent of the population lives in conditions of extreme poverty (IPECE, 2014). Over
                         16 percent of the population lives in substandard settlements (roughly 509 different favelas were
                         mapped in the city in 2010). In 2010, Fortaleza had the second largest slum population of the cities of
                         the Northeast, amounting to roughly 396,370 people (IBGE).

                         Inequalities are spatially distributed. The poorest zones of the city are located along the main water
                         bodies ➢❨ including the Maranguapinho and CearÃ¡ rivers (in the Western area) and the CocÃ³
                         river and its tributaries (in the Northeastern area) ➢❨ as well as along the beach, particularly on the
                         Western and North Eastern side. Many low-income settlements are located in areas of high risk of
                         flooding, increasing the vulnerability of an elevated number of poor households.
                         The deep inequalities that characterize the city are evident along the coastline, where wealthy
                         neighborhoods are adjacent to pockets of severe poverty. In fact, 69% of the population living in the
                         northern neighborhoods of the city has levels of income at or below three minimum salaries (IBGE,
                         2010). Originally areas of illegal occupation, they are characterized by high density, disorganized
                         and unregulated land use, lack of basic services (sewerage, water, waste collection), and an overall
                         deficiency of urban amenities. The poor live in precarious housing conditions located in
                         environmental degraded areas with critical levels of crime and violence.
                         Additionally, remote, poor southern areas are characterized by large low-income housing complexes
                         built in the 1970s and 1980s, with very limited transportation options. In subsequent years, the city
                         expanded fast and without planning towards those areas, resulting in low-rise, low density and low-
                         income residential housing. Infrastructure for the provision of basic services is deficient, mobility
                         remains very limited, and crime rates are high. Encroachment in parks and around lagoons has
                         essentially deprived the majority of the population of access to these natural spaces.
                         In short, population growth and rapid unplanned urbanization brought with them a number of urban,
                         social and environmental problems such as occupation of high risk areas, deficiencies in sanitation
                           and solid waste management systems, urban mobility bottlenecks, and environmental degradation
                           and poor quality (as expressed by the low rate of green areas per population within the city ➢❨ 4 m2
                           per inhabitant). In the city of Fortaleza, deficiencies in urban infrastructure and afforestation of

                           streets ➢❨ which can be used as good proxies for urban and environmental quality ➢❨ are strongly
                           associated with low-income households (IBGE, 2010). This association suggests the Project may
                           have positive distributional impacts.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The Project implementing agency, SEUMA, has no previous experience with the World Bank➢❨ s
                           Operational Policies. The Environmental Management Plan will assess the need for capacity
                           enhancement and include a plan for capacity building. However It➢❨ s worth mentioning that: (i)
                           Despite having never worked with the World Bank, SEUMA is the Secretariat in charge of urban
                           planning and urban and environmental management matters at the city level. The issuance of urban
                           and environmental permits, as well as the enforcement of their provisions, for instance, is also part of
                           their concerns and duties; and (ii) specifically regarding potential resettlement impacts, the Bank
                           team is already in coordination not only with SEUMA, but also with HABITAFOR, the agency in
                           charge of policymaking and execution of the overall social housing and resettlement. Whatever TA
                           to be provided to SEUMA will also be extended to HABITAFOR.
