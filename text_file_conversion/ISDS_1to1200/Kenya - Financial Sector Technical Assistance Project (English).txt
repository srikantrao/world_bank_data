A.2. Project Objectives

The overall development objective of the project is to create a sound financial system and a strengthened
legal framework and judicial capacity that will ensure broad access to financial and related legal services
and optimal allocation of resources for sustained economic growth. This objective will be achieved through
provision of technical expertise and building capacity to implement the Government's financial sector
reform program which the Bank will also support through the proposed Financial Sector Adjustment Credit
(FSAC), and through supporting activities in the judiciary and the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional
affairs (MOJCA) in the context of the Government's Medium Term Governance, Justice, Law and Order
Sector Reforms Strategy.

The project will help the authorities to address the weaknesses identified in the financial sector by the
recent joint Bank/Fund FSAP and those in the legal sector. Particular focus will be put on legal issues that
affect the efficient performance of the financial sector. This is a Technical Assistance Credit to provide
capacity and institutional strengthening and involves no capital investment in buildings or physical
structures.

A.3. Project Description
The project will have seven components:

Component 1: Financial Sector Development Strategy. The Kenyan authorities recognize that sustainable
economic recovery and broad based growth depend on a vibrant and integrated financial sector that
supports the mobilization of resources to finance investment across the economy. Sustainable access to
appropriate and secure financial services provides a critical tool for poorer households to improve their
livelihoods.

The Project will support the formulation of a financial sector strategy necessary to achieve these policy
objectives as identified in the ERS. The process will involve broad consultations among stakeholders and
will be informed by various recent studies on the financial sector, including the FSAP, the banking sector
reform strategy (undertaken for the Government by a joint team of Kenyan and international specialists and
funded by DfID) and the study on development finance institutions (DFIs) and rural finance being financed
by FIRST. The support will include: (i) Technical Advisors; (ii) Consultants to carry out studies on specific
identified issues; and (iii) Workshops for stakeholders to build broad consensus and ownership of the
reform process. For example, one of the areas already identified where further study is required is the
pension system where there are high unfunded Government liabilities and coverage is limited to people in
formal employment.

In support of the sectoral strategy, a framework for monitoring and evaluating progress in financial sector
development in Kenya will be required. This framework will need to provide a basis for assessing
performance against the higher level policy objectives, which will include measures of improved access,
stability and efficiency. The approach taken will need to be consistent with and supportive of monitoring
and evaluation efforts under the ERS. It should also provide the basis on which this Project's progress
against its overall development objectives will be monitored. The Project will support the beneficiaries in
developing and tracking appropriate indicators. Inputs will include: (i) specialist advice on enhancing
existing statistical instruments; (ii) specific pilot and baseline studies; and (iii) consultants to support the
development and implementation of the framework.

Component 2: Restructuring and Privatization of Financial Institutions. The banking system has a high
level of non performing loans concentrated in four commercial banks with state interests. Divesting the
Government's stake in these institutions will help strengthen the banking system through mobilizing the
resources of the private sector to build the operational capacity of the institutions, eliminate direct and
indirect subsidies and remove political involvement in credit allocation. The result will be to significantly
strengthen competition and improve stability which will result in downward pressure on the currently high
interest rate margins and increase the incentives to reach underserved markets. It will also demonstrate the
Government's commitment to improving governance and fiscal responsibility.

The Project will support the establishment of a specialist Bank Restructuring and Privatization Project
(BRPP) within the Ministry of Finance which will provide the specialist technical resources required to
implement the Government's policy.           The core BRPP team, comprising international and Kenyan
specialists, will guide the privatization process from the identification of strategic options for divestiture,
through short-term preparatory restructuring to preparation and completion of the transactions. This work
will be supported by specialist short-term legal and audit consultancy inputs.

Other financial institutions where the Government has a particular interest/responsibility include Co-
operative Bank, Kenya Post Office Savings Bank (KPOSB) and the development finance institutions
(DFIs). These institutions are afflicted with severe performance problems, including (in all cases except for
KPOSB) sizeable non-performing loans. The Project will support the restructuring of these institutions
consistent with the Government's market-based policy for financial sector development.

Component 3:       Strengthening Financial Sector Regulators and the Deposit Protection Fund Board.
The primary role of the Government in the financial sector is to provide a legal, regulatory, and supervisory
framework that promotes soundness and competition in the sector. Currently, the laws governing financial
sector regulators (CBK, CMA, RBA and Insurance Commission) and the DPF show several weaknesses
that hamper the effective execution of their duties. The authorities agree on the need to review these laws.
The authorities have also identified the need to strengthen supervisory capacity within the regulators as
well as information sharing and coordination of activities between regulators.

Given the absence of a regulatory and supervisory framework for the microfinance and cooperative
segments of the financial sector, the authorities are preparing legislation which aims to stimulate the
sustainable development of these sectors.

The Project will provide support for the review, amendment and/or drafting of financial sector laws that
govern all the regulators and the DPF. It will also support capacity building initiatives for these institutions,
including training needs assessment, training of staff, resident advisors, and establishment of capacity to
regulate and supervise the microfinance and SACCOs sectors under the proposed new legislation. In
addition, improvements will be made to the Management Information Services (MIS) of these institutions,
including software upgrades and purchase of hardware.

Component 4: Improving the Lending Environment. One of the major impediments to growth in Kenya
is insufficient access to financial services by large segments of the population and enterprises, especially
micro, small and medium sized ones. While there are a large number of providers of micro and SME credit,
the market is segmented and disconnected. In the formal banking sector, deficient property registration
systems, weaknesses in the creditor rights framework and institutional infrastructure, the overly debtor-

friendly enforcement mechanisms and the pervasive lack of credit information have contributed to high
lending risks as well as costly and inaccessible credit.

The Project will support: (i) improvements in the operation of the Companies Register to allow for speedy
and accurate information sharing of corporate information and data; (ii) combining of the Charges Register
and the Chattel Mortgage Register into one and moving the combined separate register (notification
system) for charges/pledges over movable assets out of the Companies Register; (iii) establishment of a
legal and regulatory framework for the operation of a credit reference bureau that would facilitate the much
needed information flow among the credit granting institutions; and (iv) introduction of a summary court
procedure for uncontested debt enforcement that would eliminate the frequent frustration of enforcement
procedures through the discretionary granting of injunctions. In addition, the project will support the review
of impediments to the growth of the leasing industry, including tax laws on leasing.

Component 5: Strengthening Debt Management and Debt Markets. The updating of Government debt
databases is handled by the individual entities in Ministry of Finance and CBK responsible for parts of debt
management and there is no coordination or consolidation of data. There is also no debt management
strategy function within Ministry of Finance and therefore there is need for creating capacity to carry out
risk analysis in order to produce periodic strategy documents. Previous efforts to establish improved debt
management practices in Kenya have floundered due to weaknesses in the supporting institutional
infrastructure.

The Project will provide technical support for setting up a unified and sustainable Debt Management Office
to be housed in the Ministry of Finance, including review of relevant legislation. The Debt Management
Office will be responsible for the creation of a consolidated data-base and debt recording system. This will
require training the relevant staff in the use of the Commonwealth Debt Recording System a new version of
which is under installation.

The financial markets in Kenya possess many features which will support further development of the
domestic government securities market. Development of debt markets is crucial to the development of long
term securities and capital markets. The Project will support a number of technical improvements with a
view to enhancing the operation of the primary and secondary debt markets. These include: (i) designing a
benchmark issuance strategy; (ii) taking measures to improve transparency in funding operations; (iii)
facilitating OTC trading in Government securities; (iv) a detailed needs assessment to support efficient
custody and settlement of Government securities; and (v) establishing a Repurchase Market in Government
securities

Component 6: Legal and Judicial Reform. Good clear laws, backed by a strong judiciary are an essential
element in creating an environment that is conducive to business and financial activity. The Government
has developed a medium term Governance, Justice, and Law and Order Sector Reform Strategy (GJLOS)
with support from a group of donors including the World Bank who are together supporting the GJLOS in a
sector-wide approach. The members of the Group are the World Bank, SIDA (joint co-chairs), Canada,
DANIDA, Finland, GTZ, the Netherlands, DFID, Sweden, USAID, EC, UNDP, Habitat, UNICEF and the
UN Office on Drugs and Crime Prevention. This project proposes to provide support to the Judiciary, law
reform institutions (Law Reform Commission, Office of the Attorney General and legislative research
division of Parliament) and legal education institutions in carrying out their parts of the GJLOS focusing in
particular on those aspects that impact the financial sector. This Project recognizes the close
interdependence between financial and legal sector reforms, and that ­ as is the case the case in the
financial secxtor ­ the effectiveness and sustainability of legal/judicial reforms depends on a
comprehensive, holistic approach to planning reform in the legal/judicial sector.

(a)       Judicial Reform:

The GJLOS identifies integrity, accountability, transparency and meritocracy as key factors in securing the
independence and authority of the judiciary. Under an ongoing World Bank project, the government has
started the computerization that will culminate in automated recording of court proceedings, automated
court case management and computerization of the court registries.

The Judiciary aims to develop a strategic action plan in order to carry out the refoms required under the
GJLOS in a systematic manner. In order to address reforms in the sector in a comprehensive manner, the
first step under the Project is to support the development of a strategic action plan that would feed into and
be part of the GJLOS reform strategy. The Plan would then identify specific reforms in the financial and
commercial areas that can be supported under the proposed Project. The development of this strategic
action plan will strengthen consensus building on administrative measures, including implementing
measures needed to accelerate judicial reforms.

The Project will support the development of the strategic plan and the implementation of agreed parts of the
plan that will enhance the legal and regulatory framework for the financial and commercial sectors.
Activities will focus on establishing the court and case management and records management systems, and
improvement of court registries (with support initially for data entry on commercial cases, as appropriate).
Support for a staff training program and more effective human resource administration and management
will also be provided. To the extent practicable, priority will be given to judicial staff that handle financial
and commercial cases.

(b)       Law reform

Law Reform is necessary to ensure that the vision and mandate of the current administration are translated
into a lasting institutional foundation. A broad legislative agenda has been proposed by the Government. In
addition, the new Constitution is expected to be in place in 2004, and it will necessitate vast law reforms.
The GOK needs to improve its capacity for legislative planning, research, drafting and information
dissemination in order to carry out this ambitious legislative agenda.

The Project will provide technical assistance to finalize the institutional review of law reform bodies,
including the Law Reform Commission, Office of the Attorney General and the legislative research service
in Parliament1, and to support these institutions in carrying out the review, harmonization and drafting of
priority laws in the financial and commercial sectors in Kenya.

     (c) Legal Education.

The sustainability of the reforms supported under the proposed Project will depend heavily on human
resource development, including continuing legal education for judges and lawyers. The Kenyan legal
education system was built upon a solid foundation, possesses internationally trained and qualified teaching
professionals, and is home to a growing and highly motivated student body. However, the system as
currently organized cannot meet its mandate of providing quality legal education in key areas such as
commercial law. As a result, the quality of legal and judicial services delivered in the commercial law field
does not support the effective implementation of commercial laws or the development of a sound financial
sector reform program. Among the obstacles identified within the legal education system are unclear
institutional mandates, low university admission and graduation standards, a lack of basic training materials
in key subject areas, poor physical infrastructure, limited advanced educational opportunities for teaching
professionals in key subject areas, outdated or nonexistent commercial law libraries, and an absence of
basic IT infrastructure and computer research facilities.

The proposed project will support a review of the institutional arrangements for legal education in an effort
to support the development of a sound financial sector. Following the review process, key legal education
institutions will be provided support to strengthen facilities, review and develop teaching curricula and
educational materials, update libraries and research capabilities, and create new training and development
opportunities for both students and faculty. Following the required general institutional capacity building,
there will be focus on areas that impact the financial and commercial sector.



1A workshop supported by DFID and the EU reviewed the existing institutional arrangements. Additional
donor support is needed to complete this review.

Component 7: Modernizing the National Payments System. Payments in Kenya are largely paper-based
and manually processed. Cash is the most common form of payment. Checks have traditionally dominated
non-cash payments, accounting for about 95 percent of non-cash payments as of June 2003. In the absence
of an electronic large value transfer system, large payments are made by check, correspondent account
transactions pursuant to SWIFT messages, or through direct transactions in the settlement accounts
maintained by commercial banks at the CBK. Retail payments systems comprising proprietary and shared
ATM networks, and electronic funds transfer at point of sale (EFTPOS), are in place but growing relatively
slowly.

The Kenyan authorities already recognize the existing deficiencies in the clearing and settlement
mechanisms and a task force has produced a framework and strategy paper for the modernization of the
national payments system which has recommended, among other things, introduction of Real Time Gross
Settlement (RTGS). The Project will provide appropriate technical assistance and funding to acquire an
integrated Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System and a Scripless Securities Settlement System /
Central Depository System (CDS) to facilitate the safe, secure and efficient clearance and settlement of
funds and securities transfers (both primary and secondary market transfers) in a manner consistent with
best international practice. In addition, the project will support the establishment of an appropriate legal and
oversight framework, and provision of expert technical advice and training for staff of the Department of
Payments System in the CBK.
