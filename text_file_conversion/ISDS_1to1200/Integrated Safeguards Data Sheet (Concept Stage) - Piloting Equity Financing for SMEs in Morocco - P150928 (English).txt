                           The Project's development objective is to encourage the private equity investment market to increase
                           the supply of early stage investment finance for innovative small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in
                           the Project Area
                           C. Project Description
                           The project activities will help young innovative SMEs develop to the stage at which they are able to
                           demand larger amounts that later-stage VC capital funds typically invest in. It will also support angel
                           investors, thereby addressing findings from the Independent Evaluation Group report on the World
                           Bank Group➢❨ s support for innovation and entrepreneurship that venture capital funds are more
                           likely to succeed where there is an adequate supply of start-ups and high-growth SMEs emerging
                           from earlier stages in the innovation process. Start-ups and innovative SMEs that have graduated
                           from early financing sources, such as angel investors, are more likely to generate sound investments
                           and deal flows.

                           analysis (if known)
                           The project will cover the following geographical areas: (a) regions of Tanger-TÃ©touan-Al
                           Hoceima, l➢❨ Oriental, FÃ¨s-MeknÃ¨s, Rabat-SalÃ©-KÃ©nitra, BÃ©ni-Mellal-KhÃ©nifra,
                           Casablanca-Settat, Marrakech-Safi, DraÃ¢-Tafilalet, Souss-Massa and (b) provinces of Guelmim,
                           Tan-Tan, and et Sidi-Ifni.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The CCG has experience through an ongoing World Bank➢❨ financed project (MSME Development
                           Project [P129326]) and has environmental and social management safeguards (ESMS) in place. The
                           CCG has a designated social and environmental coordinator tasked with screening subprojects
                           financed by banks under the MSME Development Project and categorizing activities according to
                           risk. All CCG operational staff including the environmental coordinator have received training on
                           World Bank safeguards. The CCG has been performing safeguards screening at a satisfactory level
                           and has properly excluded ineligible subprojects such as Category A projects, projects leading to
                           involuntary resettlement, activities falling under IFC➢❨ s exclusion list, and additional selected
                           activities that are expected to have a significant negative environmental and/or social impact. To
                           date, no issue has been raised on the management of safeguards aspects at the CCG. Therefore, the
                           project will utilize the same ESMS to implement the ESMF.
