2. PROJECT INFORMATION

 Current Project Development Objective
 To develop a national statistical system that effectively and efficiently delivers reliable and timely statistics in
 accordance with international standards and best practice.




3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
        The World Bank                                                                            RESTRUCTURING ISDS
        Development of a National Statistical System for Tanzania (P107722)



 The project supports the Tanzania Statistical Master Plan (TSMP) and includes the following components, which are
aligned with TSMP components:
     Component A: Institutional Development and Legal Reform which aims to improve legal and institutional
        framework of the national statistical system;
       Component B: Human Resource Capacity Development which supports the upgrade of skills as well as
        development and implementation of a new human resource policy;
       Component C: Development of Statistical Infrastructure. This component will improve the underlying systems
        and databases needed to improve the statistical standards and methodology and maintain a National Statistical
        System;
       Component D: Data Development and Dissemination which focuses on enhancing the quality and quantity of
        statistical products and services and dissemination;
       Component E: Physical Infrastructure and Equipment. This components aims to upgrade equipment, networks
        and systems and improve physical infrastructure. It also supports civil works activities to construct new office
        buildings for NBS in mainland and OCGS in Zanzibar to improve the working environment of both statistical
        offices.
       Component F: Project Management.


4. PROJECT LOCATION AND SALIENT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS RELEVANT TO THE SAFEGUARD ANALYSIS (IF
   KNOWN)
The project is national in scope. However, the only activities with possible environmental impacts stem from
the construction of two new office buildings of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Dodoma, Tanzania
and Office of Chief Government Statistician (OCGS) in Unguja, Zanzibar. These buildings are both being
constructed within well-developed urban areas. In Dodoma and Unguja, the sites are undeveloped. A land
plot No ‘8’ A NCC was allocated by the National Capital Development Authority for the construction of the
NBS office building in Dodoma and all the required procedures to own the land by the National Bureau of
Statistics have been completed and evidence available. The documents for the ownership of the land plot
and building permits for the construction of the OCGS office building in Zanzibar have been also finalized and
evidence available.

 II. KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT
       The World Bank                                                                                RESTRUCTURING ISDS
       Development of a National Statistical System for Tanzania (P107722)




A. SUMMARY OF KEY SAFEGUARD ISSUES

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any
  potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
  The anticipated impacts of the TZ STATCAP will solely come from the construction of new office buildings of the
  National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Dodoma, Tanzania and Office of Chief Government Statistician (OCGS) in Unguja,
  Zanzibar. The impacts are expected to be short term, site specific, confined and reversible and can be managed
  through well defined mitigation and monitoring measures. Potential negative impacts that could arise during
  construction include creation of debris during site clearing; pollution of air, land and water resources arising from
  equipment emissions, workshops, and waste disposal during and after construction, soil erosion and improper
  drainage of storm water . Potential social impacts that may arise include negative effects on health due to air
  pollution and noise during construction; and blockage of access during construction. These will be short-lived and
  localized impacts, all of which are addressed through the project Environmental Management Plan.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
  None

3. Describe any potential alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
  In accordance with Government of Tanzania requirements, the project undertook a full Environmental Impact
  Assessment (EIA) for each building. The EIAs include an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) outlining the specific
  measures to be implemented to mitigate against identified impacts. In the project instance, the EMPs are focused on
  managing the direct construction impacts associated with construction in an urban area.
   The EIA report will be disclosed in-country and through the Bank#s Infoshop. It will also be subject to public
  consultation prior to finalization.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower
  capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
  A review of the institutional capacities of the implementing institutions revealed that there is adequate institutional
  and regulatory capacity for environmental management at national level. The national legal framework for
  environmental management in Tanzania spells out the roles and responsibilities of different gov ernment Ministries,
  Departments and Agencies (MDA) and other stakeholders. The Environmental Management Act (EMA), 2004 (Act No.
  20 of 2004) represents a comprehensive framework law on environmental protection and management in Tanzania.
  Among other things, the Act provide for legal and institutional framework for sustainable management of
  environment; principles for management, impact and risk assessments, prevention and control of pollution, waste
  management, environmental quality standards, public participation, compliance and enforcement; and
  implementation of international instruments on environment. It also provide for the National Environment
  Management Council (NEMC), which is the national body for enforcing environmental legislation and compliance.

   The Environmental Impact Assessment and Audit Regulations No.349 of 2005 made pursuant to Section 82 (1) and
  230 (h) and (q) of the EMA, prescribes the stages and the EIA process, which are in principal managed by the NEMC.
  The regulations provide the procedures and requirements for undertaking ElAs for various types of development
  projects with significant environmental impacts. NEMC is expected to have necessary environmental capacity to
  coordinate and oversee environmental management issues in the country.

         Development of a National Statistical System for Tanzania (P107722)



  5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanism for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with
    an emphasis on potentially affected people.
    Key stakeholders related to the construction of the two office buildings are the owners and residents of nearby
    properties. The EIAs outline the measures taken to consult with such persons. The EIAs are also being publically
    consulted prior to finalization.
