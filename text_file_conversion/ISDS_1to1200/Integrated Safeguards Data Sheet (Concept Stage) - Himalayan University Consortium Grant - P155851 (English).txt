                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The development objective of this grant is to build a sustainable partnership of research institutions
                           in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region working on issues of significance to regional water resources
                           management.
                           C. Project Description
                           The grant objective will be achieved through strengthening the Himalaya University Consortium and
                           its secretariat as a platform to facilitate collaborate research partnerships among institutions in the
                           HKH region and beyond. Conferences, training programs and exchange visits will be funded to
                           facilitate contact and establishment of partnership between researchers who may otherwise not have
                           had the opportunity to meet as well as to create a network and build joint research capacity of young
                           researchers. Seed grants will be provided to develop high quality proposals for joint research on
                           issues related to the management of the transboundary water resources of the HKH region.

                           The initiative has the following components:
                           Component 1: Strengthening the network of research institutions.
                           This component will finance activities between the academic institutions across HUC current and
                           potential full and associate members to broaden the network and intensify the interactions, as well as
                           establish a collaborate web-based platform for knowledge and information exchange. Limited
                           support will be provided to strengthening the capacity of the HUC secretariat to effectively perform
                           its role, including providing essential office equipment, contributing towards the costs of the Project
                           Coordinator and Project Associate, and training in project management.

                           Component 2: Building capacity for collaborative research.
                           This component will finance conferences for knowledge exchange, training programs and exchange
                           visits to build the capacity of researchers to engage in knowledge exchange and for joint research that
                           builds on synergies between institutions and the collective expertise on water resources management
                           in the Himalayan River Basins. In addition, new grants will be provided to at least twelve institutions
                           from existing and / or potential HUC members for potential collaborative research and to two
                           existing partners for conducting already identified joint research projects.
