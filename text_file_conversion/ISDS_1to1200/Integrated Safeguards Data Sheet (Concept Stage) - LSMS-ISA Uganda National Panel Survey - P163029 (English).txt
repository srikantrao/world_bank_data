                           1.      To provide information required for monitoring the National Development Strategy, of major programs of
                           government and General Budget Support, and also to provide information to the compilation of the National Accounts

                           (e.g. agricultural production);
                           2.       To provide high quality nationally representative information on income dynamics at the household level , and
                           to provide annual information on service delivery and consumption expenditure estimates to monitor poverty and
                           service outcomes in interim years of other national survey efforts, such as the UNHS, Uganda Demographic and Health
                           Survey (UDHS) and National Service Delivery Surveys (NSDS);
                           3.       To provide a framework for low-cost experimentation with different policy interventions to e.g. reducing
                           teacher absenteeism, improving ante- and post-natal care, or assessing the effect of agricultural input subsidies;
                           4.       To provide a framework for policy oriented analysis and capacity building to support other research which will
                           feed into the Annual Policy Implementation Review; and
                           5.       To facilitate randomized impact evaluations of interventions whose effects cannot currently be readily
                           assessed through the existing system of national household surveys.

                           C. Project Description
                           The Uganda National Panel Survey aims to collect on an annual basis key outcome indicators (poverty, service delivery,
Public Disclosure Copy




                           governance, employment among other indicators) to monitor the National Development Plan. By collecting this data
                           from the same households on an annual basis, and allowing free access to the data to be independently analyzed, the
                           program will provide analyses that allows the Government of Uganda, Civil Society, Development Partners and the
                           general public to significantly improve their understanding of the reasons for change (in income, poverty or service
                           delivery). It will also cross-check the validity of routine data systems and provides frequent feedback on the
                           performance of key government programs.

                           Sustaining the program of annual national panel household surveys over the period of 2016-2020, and maintaining the
                           links to at least a sub-sample of households that have been surveyed in the period of 2009-2015 will facilitate analysis
                           of long-term, slow-moving processes such as agricultural transformation and its role in economic growth and human
                           capital development. Long-term panel studies, such as the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics or the ICRISAT panel,
                           are also the only method available to study issues such as intergenerational mobility, risk and vulnerability to shocks.
                           Continuing to collect detailed agricultural information that is solicited within a multi-topic framework and that could be
                           linked with public geospatial data with ever increasing spatial resolution, temporal resolution and thematic scope will
                           be a key ingredient for the fulfillment of the aforementioned analytical objectives, which go beyond the objective of
                           producing official statistics on agriculture.
