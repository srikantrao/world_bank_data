                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the oversight of the revenues from the
                           extractive industry in targeted countries. This will lead to a more inclusive and sustainable economic
                           growth stemming from extractive industry activities
                           C. Project Description
                           The project will consist of three components: (i) supporting the Supreme Audit Institutions of
                           selected countries to conduct audit of the revenues flow in the extractive industry; (ii) dissemination
                           of the audit manual on flow of revenue to other SAIs; and (iv) project management, monitoring and
                           evaluation.

                           Component 1: CREFIAF➢❨ s capacity to coach/mentor its members was built in the field of the
                           financial audit thanks to the support from the WB closed project which developed and tested in 5
                           countries audit guidelines and methodology in line with the International Standards for Supreme
                           Audit Institutions (ISSAI). During the implementation of this project, about 20 staff from CREFIAF
                           and the pilot SAIs were trained and accredited as ➢❨ CREFIAF experts➢❨ . Also an eLearning
                           platform was developed and all audit guidelines were adapted in eLearning training modules. The
                           proposed project will leverage on the financial audit guidelines to (i) elaborate a manual on audit of
                           the flow of revenue in line with EITI + requirement 4 on revenues collection and (ii) test this manual
                           in DRC, Gabon, Niger and Guinea. Two audits related to the flow of revenues in the extractive
                           industry will be conducted in each of these countries on two different years using CREFIAF experts
                           and the auditors from the selected SAIs. The audit will consist in (i) ensuring that the contracts

                           signed with the private sector in the extractive industry field comply with the legal framework and
                           the regulations, (ii) reconciling the revenues (host Government's production entitlement, national
                           state-owned enterprise company production entitlement, profit taxes, royalties, dividends, bonuses,
                           license fees, rental fees, entry fees, any other significant payments and material benefit to
                           Government) declared by the private sector complied with the provisions of the contracts, (iii)
                           reconciling the revenues declared by the private sector and recorded by the revenues generating
                           administrations and the public treasury. In addition, to addressing the issue of the production of an
                           audit report on the flow of revenues of the extractive industry in line with the international auditing
                           standards and EITI+ requirement 4.9, the project will pay a special to the lead time between the
                           completion of the audit and the publication of the report as to ensure a timely publication of the
                           report. During the course of these audits, the Supreme Audit Institutions will rely also on technical
                           expertise available at the Ministry of Natural Resource and synergies will be sought with CIDA➢❨ s
                           experts. Lessons learned from the audit will be incorporated to revise if needed the audit manual on
                           flow of revenues.

                           Component 2: The project will support CREFIAF to use its existing training facility (Regional
                           Training Institute and eLearning platform) to have a multiplier effect and disseminate at a lower cost,
                           the final version of the above mentioned audit manual as to strengthen the capacity of the other
                           member countries. This will be done by (i) adapting the audit manual in eLearning training modules,
                           (ii) printing the manual for dispatching in the 23 SAIs, (iii) and providing local trainings sessions in
                           10 additional countries.
                           Component 3: Coordination of the above activities will remain with the Secretariat of the CREFIAF.
                           This includes management of funds, ensuring that required outputs are delivered in an agreed
                           timeframe and the financial audit of the project proceeds are conducted on time

                           To support a sound implementation of the project supervision resources have been allocated in the
