                         The Public Financial Management Modernization Project (PFMMP) was approved by management
                         on November 7, 2013 with an original grant from the MDTF in the amount of USD 12 million. With
                         the approval of the Additional Financing in the amount of USD 7.5 million in May 2015, the total

                         project amount was increased to USD 19.5 million. The project supports two main components: (1)
                         Mobilization of Revenue and Project Management Functions of the GSC and (2) Improving the
                         budget execution processes through the implementation of the FMIS.

                         The proposed restructuring extends the closing date of the PFMMP - TF015434, from May 14, 2016
                         to May 14, 2017. This no cost extension is necessary to ensure orderly completion of key activities
                         being performed under the project as reflected in the request of the Royal Government of
                         Cambodiaâ€™s (RGC) letter dated 16 July, 2015. As a part of this restructuring, the project result
                         framework is revised and updated to better reflect realistic contribution of project activities toward
                         the Project Development Objectives (PDO) and to improve result chain respectively.

                         analysis (if known)
                         This restructuring is a no-cost extension to the original project (PFMMP), which was classified under
                         category C. The activities under this one year no cost extension do not raise the environmental
                         category of the project or trigger any new safeguard policies. As noted in the original Project
                         Appraisal Document, the project finances consulting services, goods, training and workshops. There
                         are no civil works or any activities that may have negative social and environmental implications.
