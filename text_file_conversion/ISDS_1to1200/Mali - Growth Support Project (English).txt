Project Objectives 
 
The overall project objective is to stimulate private sector investment and performance 
stemming from increased total factor productivity and from targeted sectoral sources of 
growth. The project is designed to improve the investment climate, with a focus on  
reducing the cost of doing business and on fostering growth contribution from sectors 
including mining, tourism and crafts, and telecommunications. 
Project Description 
 
This project seeks to assist Mali in implementing its growth agenda, underpinned by the 
PRSP and the private sector strategy as spelled out in the attached letter of sector 
development policies, so as to create conditions to sustain high per-capita GDP growth of 
at least 5 percent per annum.  
 
In order to achieve this objective, the cornerstone of the agenda is (i) to improve the 
investment climate as much as possible in order to increase total factor productivity 
(TFP) and foster growth, with a particular focus on SMEs and on key sectors, (ii) to 
expand the availability of the infrastructure base, and (iii) to promote business innovation 
through financial and non financial services.

NFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT FOR GROWTH 
 
This component will consist of five sub-components: (i) industrial park, (ii) Bamako airport improvement, 
(ii) expansion of telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas, (iii) support to tourism-related basic 
infrastructure, and (iv) infrastructure for productivity enhancement and linkages in the mining. 
 
Sub-component 1: Industrial park
 
In order to help Mali overcome the constraint to 
serviced industrial land
 shortage that 
hinders investment, the project will support the (i) preparation of detailed layout plans 
and engineering design for an industrial park of 50 ha (Phase 1) and supporting 
infrastructure and services, (ii) development of primary external or off-site infrastructure: 
access roads and street furniture, intersections, water, telecommunications and electricity 
supply facilities, sewerage and wastewater treatment and disposal facilities including 
costs for preparation of tender documents and technical supervision; and (iii) 
development of shared on-sites services, particularly for start up businesses. 
 
Subcomponent 2.2: Bamako Airport Improvement 
 
Bamako Airport is the primary airport in Mali handling more than 90% of the total 
national passenger traffic (327,000 passengers in 2002
1
). Bamako Airport currently 
serves more than 10 regional airlines and one international airline (Air France). The 
major passenger traffic corridors are between Bamako and Paris, Dakar and Abidjan. The 
airport was first opened in 1974, the passenger terminal was refurbished in 1994 and a 
second passenger arrival terminal was completed in 2002. The existing cargo terminal, 
managed by a state-owned enterprise, is in poor condition and freight security, in 
particular, is a major concern. A new airport fence was completed recently at a cost of 
$1.9 million to improve airport security. Even with these recent investments, the overall 
passenger and freight handling facilities are inadequate. The priority improvements 
required include the rehabilitation of passenger and freight terminal buildings and 
facilities, improvements to the runway and taxiways, parking aprons and other ancillary 
facilities and upgrading of power, water supply, waste management and 
telecommunications infrastructure. 
The project will support the following: (i) design and construction (by a private 
concessionaire) of priority improvements to Bamako Airport passenger and freight 
terminal and ancilla
ry infrastructure, (ii) 
technical assistance to secure a concession to 
1

Page  4
develop and manage the Bamako Airport, and (iii)technical assistance for the exploration 
of management and financing options for secondary airports. 
 
Sub-component 2. 3: Infrastructure for sectoral entry points 
 
Expansion of rural telecommunications and ICT.  
Under this sub-component, 
activities will aim at expanding the telecommunications network in rural areas so as to 
increase teledensity and create new opportunities in rural areas.  The project will (i) 
provide seed capital in the universal access fund in the amount of $2.5 million to launch 
the program on a meaningful scale; (ii) help prepare all upstream work which would 
allow transparent delivery of services. Project funds will cover the subsidies needed 
under an OBA scheme for a certain number of pilot projects and to provide technical 
assistance for the preparation of OBA the launching and follow up and marketing of the 
bidding process; and (iii) based on the recently finalized ICT strategy
2
,
support pilot 
multipurpose projects in selected areas, including the use of postal offices for ICT 
services. 
 
Tourism and crafts. 
In order to further stimulate the demand of Mali as a tourist 
destination, this sub-component will help improve the quality of basic infrastructure in 
the tourism sector. In the crafts sub-sector, the focus will be put on the promotion of 
traditional textile.  Hence, the project will:  (i) support the rehabilitation of a dozen 
historic monuments in Timbuku and Mopti, (ii) help provide basic accommodation (rural 
camping sites) in Mopti and Djenne; (iii) enhancement of selected tourist trails, and (iv) 
help rehabilitate and equip the traditional clothing center (“tissuthèque”). 
 
Mining development. 
Increasing the attractiveness of small-scale mining and building 
linkages are key to maximizing the economic impact of mining activities. To that effect, 
the project will support (i) the set-up and operation of pilot demonstration units for gold 
and precious stones production, and (ii) diversification efforts with a focus on plaster, 
construction material and industrial minerals (e.g. alhor, coltan).

FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
This component aims at fostering innovation in the Malian private sector through the 
provision of new financial services and of quality business development services.   
 
Sub-component 1: Access to finance 
 
This sub-component will provide technical assistance to support development intended to 
increase availability of term finance and other specialized products suitable for SMEs. It 
will consist of three products: (i) a credit enhancement facility, and (ii) a trade finance 
2
A
national ICT strategy, prepared with the support of UNDP, was recently discussed at a national 
workshop in September 2004.  
Page  5
enhancement facility. 
 
Credit Enhancement Facility
:
The product is designed to help local banks to raise 
medium and long term funding for SMEs financing. IDA and IFC will help mobilize a 
debt instrument such as a “long term certificate deposit” to be issued in the local or 
regional market by local Malian banks. This product will enable the issuer/borrower to 
access local currency term debt at competitive pricing and establishing its name in the 
market. The IDA financing would be disbursed into a escrow account and, before the 
closing of the project, the resources would be reallocated to other project components.  
 
Trade Finance Enhancement Facility
:
A
large number of the SMEs in Mali are trading 
companies which import a variety goods sold to local market. Most of these imports are 
done on cash basis and outside of the formal financial system. This is due to limited 
accessibility of trade confirmation lines from international banks available to the local 
Malian banks for trade finance. As a result, cash collateral requirements for confirmation 
of letters of credit (L/C’s) by foreign banks is very high and in many instances is 
equivalent to 100% of the value of the goods that are being imported. IFC’s Trade 
Finance Enhancement Facility is intended to increase the confirmation lines available to 
local Malian banks by providing (up to 50%) guarantee to international confirming banks 
thereby reducing the level of cash collateral required.  
 
Sub-component 2: Business development services 
 
This sub-component would address market failures that limit the ability of SMEs to 
obtain the necessary skills and business services to exploit opportunities and overcome 
bottlenecks.  The subcomponent would finance, (a) on the demand side: (i) market 
linkages, value chain program and firm-level consultancies though a matching grant and 
other BDS instruments as needed, and (ii) SME financing mentoring program; and (b) on 
the supply side: (i) consultant development and accreditation program, and (ii) 
entrepreneurship support for micro-enterprises. Under this sub-component, support will 
particularly be provided to selected value chains that have a high potential to create jobs 
for the poor (e.g. artisanal textile industry and leather activities) as well as to enterprises 
to improve their competitiveness through an increased focus on quality management.

ROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
,
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
 
The project will be implemented primarily by technical ministries and agencies involved, 
with the technical support of a project coordination unit.  During project preparation, the 
Government appointed the National Investment Promotion Center (CNPI) to serve as 
project coordinator with the support of the Financial Sector Development Project 
Implementation Unit for procurement and financial management activities. GOM is 
currently taking the necessary steps to select competitively the staff of a project 
coordination unit (PCU that will be placed under the purview of the Ministry of 
Investment Promotion and SMEs). The PCU will be accountable to the project Steering 
Committee. The PCU will oversee procurement, financial management, reporting, audits, 
monitoring and evaluation. The PCU will hire, on a need basis, technical assistance to 
help implement specific activities such as those pertaining to access to finance and direct 
Page  6
support to enterprises. 
 
While partner organizations will retain the oversight of relevant technical aspects of the 
project, the coordination arrangement will ensure the needed strong complementarity in 
both policies and implementation so as to ensure that project objectives are met. The 
PCU will be responsible for preparing bi-annual progress reports, facilitating the mid-
term progress review, ensuring adequate monitoring and evaluation and undertaking the 
impact assessment of the project, ensuring an orderly closing of the project, and leading 
the preparation of the implementation completion report.  
 
In addition to the cost entailed by the staff and the implementation of the above activities, 
the component will also finance an annual workshop on growth issues as well as a public 
information and communication campaign on project operations.  
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The Industrial Park, the Airport, and the Telecom incumbent SOTELMA are located in 
Bamako. In the mining sector activities are located mainly in the Western and the 
Southern parts of the country.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
As required under the World Bank’s procedures for Category B project, a Strategic 
Environmental Assessment Report (SESA) prepared under the Mali-Growth Support 
Project (GSP) identified the following impacts associated with this proposed project: 
 
·
Environmental and social impacts
:
The SESA has assessed the environmental and 
social potential impacts as they relate to water, land resources, and biodiversity.  It 
was established that project activities do not have such impacts.  In fact, provisions 
made in the SESA aim to foster environmental and social safeguard capacity and 
awareness building of various institutions and stakeholder groups involved in 
implementing and monitoring project activities, to include: (i) training and 
information sharing; environmental and social monitoring; (ii) sectoral norms, 
guidelines and data base development; and (iii) improvement of coordination and 
synergy among the sectors involved in environmental and social mitigatory function.   
While the establishment of an industrial zone is envisioned under this project, this 
industrial zone is to be located on vacant land owned by the Airport Authority.  
Therefore, no land acquisition or resettlement is anticipated. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The SA has also identified the following potential indirect impact which can be 
summarized as follows: 
·
workers’ can be effected by exposure to dust, noise and the treatment of some 
material; 
·
serious problem of waste management; 
·
traffic increase and disruption, increase risks of accidents because of heavy-truck 
going to the factories; 
·
Possibility of disease transmission due inappropriate methods of waste disposal 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
N/A 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The SESA study assessed the environmental and social impacts of current and future investment activities 
in the sectors involved, following national and World Bank standards. It provides measures to mitigate, 
avoid, or compensate for the negative environmental and social impacts. Proposed actions included 
technical and social measures, institutional and legal measures, research, and awareness building.  The 
Page  9
SESA also includes an Environmental and Social Management Framework, outlining mechanisms and 
institutional arrangements for screening, review and clearance of sub-projects.   
 
The SESA also identified requirements for monitoring and enforcement of recommended procedures, along 
with relevant monitoring indicators pertaining to each sector. The study clearly outlined the institutional 
a
rrangements and defined the roles and responsibilities of various parties involved in the mitigation and 
remediation action plans from institutional, legal, regulatory, and technical points of view.  In view of the 
limited institutional capacity to addressing project safeguard aspects adequately, the SESA includes 
provisions to strengthening the capacity of the various institutions and actors involved, as well as 
promoting coordination and synergy among the various sectors in attending to the potential environmental 
and social impacts. 
 
The measures outlined in the report includes, among other: 
 
·
Training, information and awareness building campaigns for relevant project 
stakeholders designed to minimizing, avoiding or compensating for potential 
negative impact of some project’s activities; 
·
Environmental and Social surveys (thematic and environmental monitoring); 
·
Monitoring and follow up at the component level; 
·
Establishment of a database to monitor the impact of the different project 
activities related to the different sectors involved. 
·
Strengthening legal and institutional framework; 
·
Institutional capacity building; 
·
Conduct sub-project EIAs and implement identified mitigation measures. 
 
The project is focusing on the first three items, while the remainder of the above listed 
measures will be addressed through other sectoral interventions. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
This SESA, from the outset until its disclosure, was carried out following broad 
consultation approach, in close collaboration with, but not limited, to the following 
Ministries: Mines; Tourism and hotel industry and associated trades, Transport; 
Infrastructures; Industries and industrial zone development; Environment and Natural 
Resources, Health, and labor.  Consultation also involved civil society, including NGOs 
at regional and local government levels, village communities representatives and other 
relevant stakeholder and interest groups. 
 
The measures taken for SESA disclosure includes: displaying SESA report at relevant 
institution in the country, including ministry of Environment, World Bank Office in the 
country etc.  In addition, it was widely publicized in local broadcasting network and news 
papers.   This was designed to not only inform project stakeholders, but also to encourage 
and promote broad public, private and civil society participation in and ownership of the 
project.  Prior to disclosure of the SESA report, the study findings were discussed by 
relevant stakeholders.  The final report benefited from their input.  
 
The EA was disclosed in - country and at World Bank InShop prior to appraisal.
