B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
1.1 
The objective of PARSEM is to support Government efforts to provide a primary and lower 
secondary education of improving quality to all children ages 6-15 in a financially sustainable manner.  The 
Education Charter postulates that all eligible young Moroccans will have access to basic education (grades 
1-9) by 2008 and that by 2015, 90% of the students enrolled in 1
st
 grade (primary school) will finish primary 
education, 80% will finish lower secondary, 60% will finish secondary education, and 40% will obtain their 
baccalaureate diploma.  To reach these targets, Government must ensure that the remaining 10% of children 
who do not receive primary education will have access to schools and that lower secondary education 
opportunities expand from current net enrollment rates of 66% to 85%.   Furthermore, the targeted success 
rates imply a considerable reduction in repetition and dropout rates.  These goals will be obtained only by 
decreasing repetition from 6% to 1% by 2005/06 at the primary level and from 14% to 1% by 2008/09 at the 
lower secondary level; dropout rates will need to decrease from 12.5% (primary) and 19.8% (lower 
secondary) to 2% by 2005/06 at both levels.  PARSEM intends to accompany Government initiatives that 
aim to meet these targets. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
Page  2
1.2 
PARSEM will support the implementation of a sub-
set of actions from the Government’s 
strategic framework.  The Bank and the Government have agreed to include in PARSEM those actions 
that have the most strategic value for achieving Government objectives as defined above.  The subset of 
actions to be supported by PARSEM have been organized into four components described below.  Three 
crosscutting principles are applied across all four components: (i) promotion of equity, particularly for 
rural girls; (ii) development of opportunities for stakeholders to participate in efforts to meet Charter 
objectives; and (iii) financial sustainability. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
National education reform program will be implemented throughout national territory.  The government 
selects sites for specific intervention based on various information systems (school maps, regional plans, 
etc.). Project to be implemented in the following regional academies (regional education jurisdictions): 
Rabat-Sale-Zemour-Zaer; Al Gharb-Chrada-Bni H’sine; Tanger-Tetoun; Fes-Boulmane; Meknes-
Tafilalet; Taz-Al Hoceima-Taounate; Orientale; Sous-Mass-Daraa; Marrakech-Tensift-Elhaouz; Tadla-
Azilal; Grand Casablanca; Chaouia-Ouardigha; and Doukkla-Abda. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
Borrower’s institutional capacity has been reviewed during pre-appraisal mission in March 2004.  Key 
issues will be incorporated in a procedural specification, to be subsequently used as an environmental and 
social framework that will be prepared before project appraisal.  This safeguard instrument is consistent 
with the SWAp approach followed in this project. From an environmental point of view, capacity to 
design and implement school construction projects will be addressed in particular.  From a social point of 
view, the issue of the land acquisition process for building schools will be also addressed in the ESF.
