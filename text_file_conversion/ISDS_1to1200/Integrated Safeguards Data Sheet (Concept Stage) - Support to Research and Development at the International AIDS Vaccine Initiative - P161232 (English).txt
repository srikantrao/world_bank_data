                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           To support the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) in the development of a novel HIV
                           vaccine candidate through a program of fundamental translational research and product development.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project will entail further research to optimize the replicating vector platform. The applied
                           research required to optimize vaccine vector design to ensure efficacy and safety of a vaccine for
                           wide-scale usage is considerable. Informed by the studies conducted as part of the project P119051
                           using Sendai virus vector candidate, the research in the current project will include iterative design
                           and the systematic investigation of modified vectors and vaccination regimens in order to identify the
                           most practical effective route and dose, mainly in a series of monkey studies. The research will help
                           identify and characterize the immunologic mechanisms that provide protection, which will inform
                           improvements in the HIV vaccine candidates as well as direct how the vector can be used to develop
                           vaccine candidates against pathogens of poverty. The project might consider clinical trials in humans
                           at a later stage.

                           IAVI is one of the leading institutions in this field of HIV vaccine research and is well positioned to
                           carry forward the replication-competent vector platform. This capacity is demonstrated in its current

                           related work in the development of VSV-based vaccines. A comprehensive assessment of IAVI's
                           financial management, procurement, and safeguard capacity was undertaken during the project
                           P119051, which concluded that IAVI has adequate rules and procedures, staff, and systems. All
                           safeguard and Fiduciary indicators were assessed as satisfactory during project preparation,
                           supervision and ICR. The organization overall had not only a good financial management system, but
                           strong systems in fiduciary risk management. The initial review of IAVI also highlighted the
                           technical know-how, experience, and procurement capacity to undertake the procurement activities
                           under the Trust Fund TF071457. Environmental due diligence note was prepared for P119051 that
                           stated that IAVI works exclusively with certified and accredited research and manufacturing
                           organizations and laboratories that meet GLP and GMP requirements. The risks and mitigation
                           measures from the due diligence note are reflected in the ISDS for the project. IAVI is familiar with
                           safeguard policies of the World Bank and has demonstrated effective safeguard management during
                           ongoing partnership with the World Bank.
