B.  Project Objectives 
[from section 2 of PCN]
If successful the proposed Project would build the capacity of the education s
ystem to make 
continuous improvements, especially in the area of the quality of teaching and learning in 
schools and the efficient use of resources.  The principal beneficiaries are therefore school and 
agency staff, which will lead, mainly after project c
losing, to improvements in services provided 
to students.
C.  Project Description 
[from section 3 of PCN]
This project is expected to be a $5 million IDA operation.  At this initial phase of project 
preparation, two basic approaches are being considered
 by the project team.
Option 1: a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp).  Under this arrangement, the Bank would agree 
with the Government and other donors/partners the project objective and an overall sector 
strategy to meet this objective.  Agreements would be so
ught with other donors to collaborate 
with the program: ideally, through pooled financing, a single PCU, and joint supervision and 
monitoring activities.  Given that most other donors are currently identifying their programs, 
now is a moment of opportunity
 to pursue a SWAp.

The Government strategy needs to be update to take into account developments under the 
existing strategy and to link the actions to improvements in quality and efficiency.  
Disbursements into the Government’s budget would then be made
 against actions taken by the 
Government: these might include things like completion and evaluation of teaching training or 
preparing a budget plan based on expected outcomes.  Procurement would be through 
government systems.  During project implementation
, agreement would be reached on activities 
which would lead towards project objectives in the light of experience.  This approach has not 
yet been discussed with the Government.
Option 2: a simple investment project, though with some links to other donor 
projects.  The 
Government has indicated its priorities are:

 
Teacher professional upgrading: Build the capacity of the Ministry of Education and 
Science and other institutions to upgrade teachers’ skills and knowledge and then to use 
that capacity to train
 a proportion of teachers.  The MOES would like to develop a career 
incentive scheme, including ‘promoted posts’, to give some teachers higher salaries.  

 
Education technology and materials: Support the implementation of the MOES’ ICT 
strategy, giving par
ticularly emphasis to improving access for poor and, possibly, rural 
communities and to integrating of ICT into teaching and learning.  Provision of books 
and other learning materials.

 
Assessment: Support to the proposed new assessment centre.
In additio
n, the PHRD grant is also exploring ways the Project might improve system monitoring 
and efficiency.  This would include development of a system to monitor quality, efficiency, 
equity indicators, and the cost
-
effectiveness of education spending, to improve
 the capacity of 
decision makers (at various levels of the system) to use systematic information in their day
-
to
-
day management of resources.  Support could also be provided to 
improve strategic planning, 
and budget preparation and execution in the Ministr
y, to enable the Government to pay off 
arrears, make more reliable payments, and to meet its policy priorities more efficiently.
