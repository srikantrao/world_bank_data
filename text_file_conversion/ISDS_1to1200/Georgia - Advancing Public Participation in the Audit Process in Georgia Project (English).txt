                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The project’s overall objective is to enhance the quality and credibility of public external audits in
                           Georgia by mainstreaming citizen engagement into the external audit process. Specifically, the
                           projects aims to:
                           1.      Increase public awareness of how the role of State Audit Office of Georgia (SAOG)
                           contributes to the efficient management of public resources;
                           2.      Develop the capacities and skills of both SAOG and non-executive stakeholders (mainly
                           CSOs, academics, parliamentarians, economic journalists) to engage constructively across
                           throughout the audit cycle; and
                           3.      Establish mechanisms to institutionalize participation of citizen participation and demand-
                           side actors in external audit process.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project responds to a new global trend where Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) are increasingly
                           looking for innovative ways to engage citizens and leverage the capacity of civil society. It builds on
                           the emerging global consensus that impact of external audit on strengthening overall PFM system
                           can be improved through the involvement citizen and non-executive stakeholders.

                           The proposed activities with their outputs are divided into three components: (i) Multi-stakeholder
                           Awareness Building ($30,000); Capacity Building for Engagement Strategy and Action Plan (USD
                           75,000); and Knowledge Capture & Regional Learning (USD 20,000).

                           Component 1: Multi-stakeholder Awareness Building (USD 30,000)

                           The objective of this component is to develop the enabling environment for engagement of non-
                           executive government stakeholders across the audit cycle by building internal and external
                           stakeholder appreciation and readiness to mainstream citizen engagement in the audit process.


                           Component 2: Capacity Building for Engagement Strategy and Action Plan (USD 75,000)

                           The objective of this component is to leverage existing global knowledge to enhance the capacity of
                           all stakeholders and to create the core technical conditions for the development and
                           operationalization of a jointly defined strategy and action plan to engage non-state actors in the audit
                           process.

                           Component 3: Knowledge Capture & Regional Learning (USD 20,000)

                           This component is intended to capture lessons from this project and facilitate learning, awareness
                           building, and knowledge sharing with other countries in ECA. As an early mover on the SAI-citizen
                           engagement approach in the region, this activity is expected to have important demonstration effects.
                           SAOG will capture and document the process and disseminate the experience to serve as a model
                           among other countries in the region.
