                           B. Project Objectives
                           The project development objective is to increase levels of compliance with tax and customs
                           obligations.
                           C. Project Description
                           The Project has been designed to help address structural weaknesses and targets areas for
                           improvement that are linked to the main causes of existing weak management of the tax
                           administration and the low tax culture in the country. Aspects related to the weak internal governance
                           framework in SAT, the outdated core business and support processes, the weak controls on tax
                           compliance and customs, and the lack of transparency in SAT, are being specifically targeted as
                           areas of intervention for this operation. The operation comprises three components designed to cover
                           vertical and transversal interventions to strengthen the overall SAT governance framework and to
                         increase its effectiveness. Each of the three components is designed to tackle structural weaknesses
                         in the Guatemala'➂❨➂ s tax system that contribute to low tax compliance and therefore low revenue
                         collection. While component 2 is designed to support vertical interventions to strengthen internal

                         revenues and customs functions, components 1 and 3 are seen as crosscutting interventions aiming at
                         strengthening the overall governance framework in SAT as well as the development of integrated tax
                         intelligence and tax enforcement procedures to enhance SATÃ¢➂❨➂ s effectiveness.

                         Component 1. Transparency, Integrity and Institutional Development in SAT

                         The objective of this component is to support implementation of the new SATÃ¢➂❨➂ s governance
                         model by supporting the implementation of the recently approved amendments to the Organic Law
                         of SAT and by strengthening its internal capacities in areas related to strategic planning, human
                         resource management, institutional integrity, information governance, and information and
                         communication technology (ICT) services. It will also support implementation of a change
                         management strategy and communications initiatives to ensure successful implementation of the
                         proposed reforms. Activities to be supported by this component will be organized under the
                         following sub-components:

                         Management of the SAT Reform. This sub-component will focus on the development and
                         implementation of a reform strategy in SAT by: (i) designing and institutionalizing strategic planning
                         and Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) tools; (ii) designing and implementing an ICT Governance
                         model; and (iii) designing and implementing a change management strategy (including a

                         services, establishing a performance management framework, developing and implementing a more
                         rigorous screening process for staff recruitment, and designing and implementing an internal capacity
                         development and knowledge management program for staff; and (ii) the development and
                         implementation of a transparency and institutional integrity strategy including the establishment and
                         implementation of the new Internal Investigation Unit, the strengthening of the internal audit
                         functions, and design and implementation of an industrial security plan for staff at all levels
                         including physical and legal protection based on the nature of their functions and the associated risks
                         following international experiences.

                         Upgrading and Integration of the Information Technology Platform. This sub-component will finance
                         the required investment for the updating and upgrading of the ICT platform aligned with the SAT
                         reform strategy. It will include the following activities: (i) designing of a new organizational model
                         for the ICT department; (ii) improving ICT planning and Project management capacities; (iii)
                         designing of a new and comprehensive software architecture ensuring integration all SAT functions;
                         (iv) upgrading the ICT infrastructure to support the reform process including improving information
                         security and establishing a data recovery center.

                         Component 2. Strengthening of Tax Collection Functions in Internal Revenues and Customs

                         The purpose objective of this component is to strengthen the core processes of the primary tax
                         collection and controls functions in both Internal Revenues and Customs with a view to enhancing
                         taxpayer voluntary compliance, taxpayer satisfaction and SATÃ¢➂❨➂ s efficiency. This component
                         will support: (i) review and redefinition of core processes and management instruments for revenue

                         collection; (ii) the upgrade, replacement and development of information systems; and (iii) the
                         implementation of electronic services for taxpayers. While the component does not envision a
                         comprehensive overhaul of the internal revenues management system, it would support the
                         replacement or upgrading of selected modules. Two sub-components are envisioned under this
                         component:

                         Strengthening of Internal Revenue Collection Processes. This subcomponent will focus on the
                         redesign and implementation of an integrated tax compliance model by: (i) redesigning and
                         improving the taxpayer registration system (Registro Tributario Unico); (ii) redefining and
                         implementing a new model for the Taxpayer Current Account (TCA) with the 360➃❪Â° approach ;

                         information for effective collection control; (iv) implementing tools and methodologies to improve
                         effectiveness of administrative collection and tax arrears recovery including initiatives and programs
                         to foster compliance and deter omission practices using behavioral economic approaches; and (v) the
                         development and implementation of a comprehensive strategy for improving taxpayer services
                         including improvements in the existing face-to-face services provided in regional offices, the
                         expansion of electronic services, and the implementation of a taxpayer satisfaction survey model.

                         Strengthening of Customs Services. This subcomponent will support the following activities: (i)
                         implementation of a risk-based management model for merchandise controls, including ex-post
                         document controls and the Trusted Operator Program ; (ii) development and implementation of
                         streamlined and automated customs procedures and mechanisms, including a joint administrative
                         inspection model with all the various border control agencies; (iii) implementation of non-intrusive
                         technologies and electronic tracking devises for merchandise control at the customs entrances, exits
                         and transits; (iv) strengthening controls over special customs regimes (free zones and others); (v)

                         facilitating information exchange with other national and international agencies by applying
                         international conventions and developing regional and bilateral agreements with neighboring
                         countries; and (vi) increasing transparency and predictability in Customs services by improving and
                         implementing modern valuation methodologies and tool, implementing standardized application of
                         norms and procedures at customs offices, improving availability and quality of customs information
                         to staff, trade operators and other users, creating consultation and feedback mechanisms between
                         traders and customs, and improving transparency on the VAT devolution process for exports.

                         Component 3. Strengthening of integrated Tax Intelligence and Tax Enforcement capabilities

                         The objective of this component is to strengthen tax intelligence and tax enforcement capabilities of
                         SAT. The component will promote an efficient use of tax information sources to support the
                         auditing, control and enforcement functions through the adoption of an integrated compliance risk
                         management model, the promotion of a culture of information analysis within SAT, and the
                         strengthening of tax auditing and legal services for a more effective detection of evasion and tax
                         fraud practices and the effective collection of disputed taxes. The proposed model will cover both
                         internal revenues and customs in order to deter existing silo-based practices and to increase
                         effectiveness of the tax intelligence function through the effective access and use of all available
                         information. The component comprises three sub-components:
                           Strengthening Tax Intelligence and Tax Audit. This sub-component will focus on: (i) the creation
                           and implementation of the new Tax Intelligence Unit; (ii) the design and implementation of an
                           integrated risk-based management model covering both internal revenues and customs; (iii) the

                           processes.

                           Strengthening Legal Services and Tax Appeals Procedures in SAT. This sub-component will focus
                           on the following activities: (i) creation of a strategy and development of analytical tools to support
                           tax litigation processes and strengthening capacity of the SATÃ¢➂❨➂ s Legal Department; (ii)
