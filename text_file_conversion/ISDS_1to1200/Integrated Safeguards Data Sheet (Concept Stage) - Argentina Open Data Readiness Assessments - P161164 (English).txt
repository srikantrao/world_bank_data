                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The objective is to support Argentina advance and strengthen the country➢❨ s Open Data initiative,
                           including open access to their national statistical data and other data. By opening data, Argentina will
                           increase government transparency, provide information for evidence-based decision-making,
                           improve public sector service delivery, increase economic opportunities and foster citizen
                           engagement in public policies and projects. Open Data helps increase the use of statistics that
                           governments produce, a key action item in the Busan Action Plan for Statistics.
                           C. Project Description
                           Open Data is one of the key pillars under the Busan Action Plan for Statistical Development. NSOs
                           in developing countries and their NSDS have started to work on improved data dissemination, data
                           documentation and data quality, all of which can be enhanced by the implementation of a national
                           Open Data initiative. By opening data from a variety of public agencies to the wider public, data
                           producers pay more attention to their quality standards and increased scrutiny of data leads to create
                           both further pressures for quality improvement and assistance in doing so from other actors,
                           particularly if appropriate feedback mechanisms are in place.

                           The project will support the Government of Argentina in the establishment of a National Open Data
                           Initiative that will set up such mechanisms. Overall opening statistical and administrative records
                           data will extend their re-use and value, and will amplify the value of other improvements made as
                           part of the NSDSs.

                           The proposed project will include three activities:

                           Activity #1 - Open Data Assessment and Action Plan
                           The funds will finance preparation of Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA) in Argentina and
                           the development of the corresponding Open Data Action plan. The ODRA will be carried out in
                           close collaboration with the recently created Ministry of Modernization which is also in charge of the
                           Open Government and Innovation agendas. Additionally, the Open Data diagnosis will include the
                           assessment of the availability of statistical data and provide priority actions for implementation with
                           the Argentinian National Statistical Office during the loan project.

                           Argentina has recently requested the support of the WBG to prepare a new loan project for the
                           Ministry of Modernization. During the identification mission conducted in early April 2016 for this
                           upcoming loan project a subcomponent on Open Data was identified. The proposed ODRA help
                           catalyze Argentina➢❨ s Open Data agenda by providing (i) key diagnostic inputs, and (ii) an action
                           plan.

                           Activity #2 ➢❨ Open Data Action Plan Prioritization and Budget
                           This activity seeks to complement ODRA outputs by including a prioritization of actions and a
                           detailed budget with estimated costs for quantifying the Open Data Action Plan resulted from the
                           ODRA. This way, the design of the Government of ArgentinaÂ´s Open Data Program from will be
                           informed in terms of (i) priority actions to be implemented according to impact and feasibility; and
                           (ii) resources (financial and human) needed to implement the ODRAÂ´s action plan.

                           Activity #3 ➢❨ Lessons learned from ODRA as a planning tool.
                           This activity will focus on extracting lessons learned from the experience of conducting an ODRA

                           for catalyzing a National Open Data initiative. The objective is to provide inputs and inform
                           governments about how ODRA methodology can be applied as a diagnostic and planning tool to
                           support an Open Data initiative.
