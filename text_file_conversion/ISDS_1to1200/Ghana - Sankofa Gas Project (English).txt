B. Project Objectives

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the availability of natural gas for clean
power generation by leveraging private capital investment.

C. Project Description

The proposed Sankofa Gas Project is designed to substitute expensive, imported, liquid fuel used
by the power sector of Ghana with domestic, natural gas, as well as enable new gas-fired power
generation capacity to be constructed. The Project supports the development of the gas reserves
of the Offshore Cape Three Points (OCTP) block, which includes the non-associated gas fields
Sankofa and Gye Nyame (“Sankofa Gas Field?) as well as the Sankofa East oil field. The
technical development of the different fields (oil and gas) is slightly sequenced and for this reason
the joint development of both OCTP components is referred to as Phase 1 (oil) and Phase 2
(natural gas). The proposed IDA/IBRD support will only apply to the OCTP’s Phase 2 (gas)
development and related commercial agreements. The oil development structure under the
OCTP’s Phase 1 will not benefit from IDA/IBRD support.

Exploiting the Sankofa field’s non-associated gas reserves will be a game changer for Ghana. The
field is capable of providing 170 mmcfd of base-load supply for nearly 15 years, or gas to fuel
1,000 MW of power generation. Export of 131 million barrels of oil to the global markets is also
expected from the OCTP development. The Project will therefore also help to address Ghana’s
macroeconomic challenges by bringing in much needed dollar-based revenues. The Sankofa gas
field is planned to come on line in the first quarter of 2018 and to be in production for almost two
decades thereafter, while gas from other Ghanaian fields is expected to at plateau level of
production by 2018 and decline starting in 2020.

The OCTP is developed by Eni S.p.A of Italy (“Eni?) and Vitol Group of Switzerland (“Vitol?),
together “Private Sponsors?. Eni is the operator of the OCTP block, holding a 47.2 percent
participating interest, with Vitol holding 37.8 percent, and the Ghana National Petroleum
Corporation (GNPC) the remaining 15 percent (GNPC's participating interest is carried by the
other partners). The Private Sponsors will develop the OCTP through their local subsidiaries and
in form of an unincorporated Joint Venture (“JV?). The OCTP will use a shared floating
production storage and offloading unit (FPSO), which can process both oil and natural gas. The
non-associated gas development will consist of five wells linked to the FPSO. A subsea pipeline
will carry the gas from the FPSO to an onshore receiving facility at Sanzule. From there, a
connection will be made to a 20-inch pipeline that connects another oil and gas field, Jubilee,
with thermal generation plants at Aboadze, near Takoradi in Western Ghana.

D. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis

The Sankofa Gas Field is in the Gulf of Guinea, at a depth of about 1000m, approximately 60 km
south of the Ghanaian coastal community of Atuabo. Gas will be transmitted from the FPSO via a
63-km undersea pipeline that makes its landfall slightly to the west of the community of Sanzule,
in the Western Region of Ghana. From the landing point, a pipeline of approximately 800 m will
convey the gas to the Onshore Receiving Facility (ORF) for compression. A short pipeline will
carry the compressed gas to the GNGC pipeline, adjacent to the ORF site to the north. With the
exception of small patches of swamp forest and wet evergreen forest, the forest that may once
have been on the ORF site has been disturbed by human activity -- mainly plantations of cassava,
pineapple, coconut, and oil palm. The shore crossing itself will be relatively easy because the
beach is deep sand without rock. Endangered sea turtles and various marine mammals including
whales frequent the Gulf of Guinea, which is also an important resource for artisanal and
commercial fisherfolk. Sea turtles use the Ghanaian beaches for nesting. There are no seagrass
beds or living coral reefs in the Project-affected area.

III.    Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1.      Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Acquisition of approximately 96 ha of land for the ORF will affect the livelihoods of an estimated
238 farmers, of which 199 are likely to be eligible for compensation. Other potential impacts of
construction and operation, all considered low to moderate in significance, include: social conflict
and spread of disease resulting from influx of workers and employment seekers; increased traffic
on roads and in coastal waters with resulting risk of accidents; temporary disturbance of turtle
nesting (if any) at the pipeline landfall; air and water pollution; noise and related disturbance to
communities and marine mammals and fish; solid and liquid waste generation; and conflicts
between fishermen and JV security personnel. Any large-scale, significant impacts would be
caused by unplanned events of low probability but could have severe consequences, such as a
major oil spill at the FPSO that could damage shoreline habitat, degrade water quality, interfere
with fishing, and have trans boundary consequences.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
The potential cumulative impacts in the area relate primarily to other oil and gas development in
the region, some existing (i.e., the Jubilee field and the Atuabo gas processing facility), some
planned and in progress (e.g., Phase 1 of OCTP, TEN, and port development), and some under
consideration (e.g., an LNG receiving terminal). The impacts considered potentially significant
are greenhouse gas emissions, oil spills, land take (particularly of farmland) for facilities related
to oil and gas development and other infrastructure, pressure on natural resources (especially
fisheries), public infrastructure and social services as a result of population influx triggered by the
developments, and related impacts on livelihoods of farmers and fisher-folk. GHG emissions and
large oil spills would also cause trans boundary impacts. Possible development of new gas-fired
generation plants would cause indirect impacts. On the positive side, the region stands to benefit
economically from these developments, provided they are guided by sound land use plans. To the
extent that natural gas replaces crude oil that is presently one of the main energy sources for
power generation in Ghana, air quality improvements and a net reduction in GHG emissions
would result.
3.       Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
The developer evaluated a range of locations and mooring types for the FPSO, rigid versus
flexible risers and flowlines for the gas wells, different techniques to manage drilling fluids, and
alternative locations for the ORF. Once the ORF site was selected, the site boundaries were
modified in consultation with the Sanzule community, and its overall size was reduced, to avoid
physical displacement of residents, protect an important item of cultural heritage, allow continued
community access through the site to forest and farmland, and preserve space for future
expansion of Sanzule.

4.      Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues.
Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower has in place an ESMS based on Eni’s corporate integrated management system that
meets or exceeds Performance Standards requirements. The borrower has prepared an
Environmental, Social, and Health Impact Assessment (ESHIA) which includes a framework
Environmental, Social, Health and Safety Management Plan (ESHMP) that will guide preparation
of detailed management plans for construction and operation. Twenty-four sub-plans will
eventually be formulated – five are already completed -- covering activities such as waste
management, fisheries management, biodiversity management, community health, medical
emergencies, emergency response, and environmental and social investment. The ESHIA
addresses cumulative and trans boundary impacts. A Livelihood Restoration Plan (LRP) is in
process. The Borrower has prepared an Oil Spill Contingency Plan that incorporates best industry
practice, including lessons learned from recent accidents. Each well will have an individual well
management plan, and the plans and designs will be reviewed by Eni spa corporate management
before drilling begins. Eni Ghana has current ISO 14001 and OSHAS 18001 certifications.

The Eni Ghana Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Guidelines and Protocols delineate the
HSE responsibilities assigned to all personnel throughout the Company and require contractors to
manage HSE in line with the Guidelines and Protocols and to monitor compliance by their
subcontractors. The Managing Director is responsible for assuring that the HSE-Integrated
Management System is developed and implemented via the provision of adequate resources. The
Eni Ghana Health, Safety, Environment and Community Investments (HSE&CI) Department is
headquartered in Accra, where staff overseeing construction, commissioning and operations will
be located. Its manager reports to the Managing Director. HSE staff will also be located in
Takoradi to facilitate HSE and social performance oversight of site activities as well as to allow
direct interface and access for stakeholders in the Western Region. These staff will manage the
successful implementation of the ESHMP and the continuation of the stakeholder consultation
process. During commissioning and operations, HSE staff will also be located offshore. The HSE
Department will need to add staff in order to carry out its responsibilities. The JV will engage an
independent consultant to monitor ESHMP implementation during project development.

5.       Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Stakeholder consultations began with stakeholder identification conducted by Eni Ghana in 2013,
prior to the scoping for the Phase 1 (oil phase) ESHIA. Groups identified consisted of: national
ministries and agencies, regional government and district assemblies, directly affected
communities along the coastline, national and local NGOs, community-based organizations and
groups, international organizations, and others, including the oil and gas industry, businesses,
religious organizations, and political parties. Consultations with these stakeholders continued
during preparation of the SGP ESHIA. Issues and concerns they raised are listed in the ESHIA,
and the way they were handled is tracked in the report. For SGP, the broad list of stakeholders
remained the same, but a group of “primary stakeholders? was identified in the communities that
would or might be directly affected by the ORF -- Sanzule, Krisan, Eikwe Bakanta, Atuabo and
Asemdasuazo. These stakeholders consisted of: local residents, traders, fishers, farmers and
plantation owners, agricultural producers (palm oil, coconut oil, and palm wine), youth, women,
refugees, religious groups, the elderly, and traditional healers. Consultations occurred at scoping,
during baseline data collection, in connection with livelihood restoration planning, and on the
draft ESHIA. Consultation with Sanzule leaders resulted in modifications to the ORF site
boundaries to respond to community priorities. Eni Ghana presented the draft ESHIA at a
stakeholders’ meeting in Sanzule on March 31, 2015 and posted a link to it on the company’s
website on April 3, 2015. Ghana’s Environmental Protection Agency published the draft ESHIA
nationally on May 30, 2015, and placed a copy for public inspection at its Western Regiond
office in Sekondi on April 20. On May 13, EPA placed additional copies at the offices of the
Western Regional Coordinating Council and the Ellembelle District Assembly, and at the
Paramount Chief’s palace in Atuabo. EPA l conducted a formal public hearing in Sanzule on May
29, 2015. The Sankofa Gas Project ESHIA includes a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) that
will guide the JV’s engagement with the communities during project development and operations.
The SEP includes a grievance mechanism and calls for appointment of a Community Liaison
Officer (already in place, based in the project area) and a Fisheries Liaison Officer still be
appointed. Eni Ghana has established a Steering Committee with Sanzule Village to facilitate
resolution of issues that may arise and deal with topics such as the content of the community
development program. IFC disclosed the Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS) for
the Project on its website on May 22, 2015, and the ESRS was disclosed in the InfoShop on the
same day.
