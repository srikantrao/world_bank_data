A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The development objective is to strengthen the Government’s ability to undertake mining 
sector reform by (i) building MEC capacity for closing uneconomic mining enterprises 
through support for closing complex mines and ancillary enterprises in an 
environmentally sustainable manner; and (ii) providing support to the National Agency 
for Programs Development and Implementation for the Reconstruction of the Mining 
Regions (NAD) for socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions.  
 
This project is the second Bank operation supporting the restructuring of the Romanian 
mining sector. The first project involved support for closure of 31 mines, social 
mitigation support for redundant mine workers through creation of 10,000 alternate jobs, 
and institutional development to build Government capacity to manage the mining sector 
through a new mining law, finalization of a Mine Closure Manual, and specialized 
studies on subsidy management, strategic environmental assessment, and poverty and 
social impact analysis. The second project builds on the lessons of the first loan by 
focusing attention on more complex mines (e.g. sulphur), initiating implementation of 
SEA recommendations, and job creation through ALMPs aimed at individual job seekers 
to improving the environment for economic growth and social regeneration in the mining 
regions. 
 
Page  2
The Mine Closure and Environment component of the project aims to: 
(i) 
Complete the closure and rehabilitation of mine sites where production is 
terminated and thereby reduce environmental impacts and the environmental 
legacy of the mining sector in line with accession requirements for EU, and 
return former mine land to other social and economic purposes. 
(ii) 
Improve the mining sector environmental performance. 
 
The Socio-Economic Regeneration component is designed to: 
(i) 
Scale up the job creation measures implemented under the first loan. 
(ii) 
Support local development activities through community capacity building 
and financing of economic infrastructure and social services;  
Streng
then the Borrower’s capacity to implement the socio-economic regeneration 
program.   
 
Key performance indicators are: 
·
Subsidy monitoring system shows decline in level of subsidies to meet EU target 
dates; 
·
Hard budget constraints on mining companies to prevent accumulation of 
additional arrears for state and  municipal taxes, and electricity tariffs;  
·
Number of mines and mining enterprises closed in an environmentally sound 
manner 
·
Area of land rehabilitated and handed over to other users or back to the 
community 
·
Number of jobs created by the project 
·
Number of beneficiaries from employment and training incentives scheme 
(ETIS); 
·
Number of additional loans, and amount disbursed by micro-credit program 
·
Repayment rate of micro-credit loans 
·
Number and value of sub-projects implemented under SDSMC 
·
Number of community groups in mining settlements mobilized through successful 
Small Grants Scheme (SGS) implementation 
·
Number of mining settlements that are able to access resources from other 
programs for local development activities. 
 
The project is contributes to the Bank’s CAS objective of supporting the Government’s 
program: 
 
The Government’s program lays the basis for a pragmatic approach to reforming the economy and raising 
living standards by improving the quality of Government services and creating an attractive business 
environment. 
…Bank Group assistance will support a broad set of structural and sectoral 
reforms to accelerate growth and pave the way for Romania’s eventual accession to the EU.
 
The project is designed to support the Mining Strategy by tackling critical bottlenecks in 
the reform process that have slowed down mining sector restructuring through measures 
that improve social and economic opportunities for the poor (i.e. those impoverished by 
Page  3
sector restructuring) that will enable the  Government to move forward on critical and 
irreversible steps of the sector restructuring program. This approach was identified as one 
of the key recommendations of the CDF process. 
 
The project also contributes to the structural agenda by helping to create conditions that 
will enable the Government to close uneconomic mines and phase out quasi-fiscal 
deficits that undermine the sustainability of the energy sector. Loss-making mining 
companies remain a major source of arrears to the utility companies, especially 
electricity. However, subsidies to mining companies and arrears have continued, 
ostensibly to protect jobs in the mining regions. By shifting focus from social mitigation 
to socio-economic regeneration in mining regions, the project creates the basis for 
accelerating the reform program. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
A.  
The Mine Closure and Environmental component (total cost US$72 million and 
loan amount of US$58 including contingencies) of the Project will: 
 
(i) 
Support the closure and environmental rehabilitation of mines and/or mine 
processing facilities at 20 sites as well as other sites to be identified; and 
(ii) 
Help start implementation of the recommendations of the Sector 
Environmental Assessment which was conducted in 2002. 
 
Physical Works.
 The government has proposed 20 sites from 7 regions for closure based 
on criteria agreed with the World Bank including size, technical complexity, cost, 
environmental and social impact. While production has previously been stopped at many 
of these sites, the sites have never been closed and properly remediated. Mine buildings, 
equipment and environmental liabilities will be addressed in the closure process and the 
land will be reclaimed to allow use for beneficial new purposes.  Nine of the 20 sites are 
located in the Jiu Valley where land for development and agriculture is scarce.  The 
project will coordinate closely with the proposed World Bank supported Jiu Valley 
regional development project on the timing of the closures to assist in the optimum 
transfer of the land for new uses.  These are also sites where subsidies have been high and 
closure will thus assist in reducing mining sector subsidy needs.  The sites include coal, 
lignite, copper, polymetalic (copper, gold, lead), and sulfur mines, as well as mine 
processing facilities. One site, the Caliman Sulphur mine, will be especially challenging 
due to its size and environmental issues, and accounts on its own for almost 20% of the 
mine closure component. The physical works to close the mines and environmental 
rehabilitation works will take from 2 to 4 years per site. The mine closure activities will 
also provide a short term boost to the local economy as most workers and supplies are 
procured locally. 
 
Technical Support. 
The first Mine Closure and Social Mitigation Project (MCSMP) built 
a
legal and technical base for mine closure in Romania that will be utilized in the new 
project. In addition to the 20 sites to be closed under the Project the Government is 
closing an estimated addit
ional 120 sites using its own procedures and sources of funds. 
Page  4
The Governments closure procedures have been modified in line with the procedures 
used in the Bank project and are considered in line with good international practice. 
Technical assistance, through technical audits to ensure international best practice on 
physical closure and environmental works, will be continued under the Project. As in the 
first project, training will be provided to transfer knowledge on closure practices from the 
Project to the broader Government closure program implemented by the Consolidated 
Group for Mine Closure (CGMC). The project will also assist in the preparation of 
technical mine closure manuals for salt and uranium mines. An application for donor trust 
funds has been made  to fund preparation of these manuals. 
 
The environmental sub-component
 (total cost US$0.95 million and loan amount US$0.81 
million) seeks to improve environmental performance in the mining sector. A Sector 
Environmental Assessment (SEA) was conducted in 2001 and was extended and updated 
in 2003 under the MCSMP and the new Project will implement some of the SEA’s key 
recommendations. The sub-component will prepare (a) a manual for implementation of 
an environmental management system in the mining sector; (b) a manual for 
environmental protection procedures in the mining sector; (c) guidelines for integrated 
monitoring of environmental impacts generated by mining activities; and (d) and 
implement an environmental monitoring  pilot project in two sites, Calimani and Baia de 
Aries. 
 
B.  
Socio-Economic Regeneration:
The Socio-Economic Regeneration (SER) component of the Project will scale up the job creation activities 
piloted by the MCSMP and will add sub-components to foster local conditions for economic growth and 
social regeneration based on the lessons learned. The total base cost of this component will be US$68 
million, excluding contingencies, of which US$57 million will be from the loan. The main objectives of the 
SER component are to: 
 
1. 
Scale up the job creation measures implemented under the first loan. 
2. 
Support local development activities through community capacity building and 
financing of economic infrastructure and social  services; 
3. 
Strengthen the Borrower’s capacity to implement the socio-economic 
regeneration program.  
 
Since the sector restructuring process started in 1997, unemployment indicators in mining regions have 
tended to lag behind other regions in Romania, justifying targeted support to mining communities. The 
following three job creation activities are being implemented under the MCSMP and will be scaled up 
under the proposed  project. 
1. 
Employment and Training Incentives Scheme (ETIS):  The scheme provides a financial incentive to 
potential employers to hire unemployed workers, enabling expanding businesses to hire and retrain 
unskilled workers. The ETIS is expected to create employment for an estimated 8,000 people.  
2. 
Micro-Credit Scheme:  After initial delays to enact a new law and regulations for micro-credit, 
implementation proceeded rapidly under MCSMP through two Romanian NGOs that manage $3.6 
million in revolving funds for the first loan. The average cost of job creation under the first loan has 
been $1,720. The micro-credit scheme will support an estimated 10,000 jobs under the second 
project.  
3. 
Workspace Centers: Ten Workspace Centers were created under the MCSMP in former mine 
buildings. The project will finance management contracts for three years to administer the Centers, 
incubate new businesses and provide enterprise suppor
t
training to aspiring entrepreneurs. 
Page  5
Subsequently, the Workspace Centers will be handed over to local governments under new 
management arrangements to be developed during this project. The project will also finance 
purchase of common equipment to facilitate functioning of enterprises at the Workspace Centers. 
The Workspace Centers will incubate 180 new enterprises, while an estimated 6,000 jobs will be 
stimulated through this subcomponent. 
A
second series of activities (4-7) is aimed at supporting local development activities 
through community capacity building and financing of economic infrastructure and social 
services.  
 
4. 
Social Development Schemes for the Mining Communities (SDSMC): The MCSMP was 
restructured in the first quarter of 2004 and $5.5 million of savings from the mine closure activities 
was re-allocated to finance Social Development Schemes among mining communities. This sub-
component is implemented by the Romanian Social Development Fund, which has a track record of 
success in implementing two previous Bank loans, under a collaboration arrangement for 
implementation of this sub-component. The SDSMC will be scaled up and will continue to be the 
responsibility of the RSDF, as a sub-component of the socio-economic regeneration program. 
5. 
Municipal Infrastructure: Infrastructure facilities within and to mining communities have been in a 
state of decline since the mining industry collapsed. The Borrower has requested financing to enable 
mining municipalities to finance municipal infrastructure schemes to be identified through a process 
of community consultation and local development planning in mining localities that will be severely 
affected by sector restructuring.  
6. 
Small Grants Scheme (SGS): The project will scale up the micro-projects piloted by DfID under the 
MCSMP to implement micro-projects aimed at human resource development and improving the 
welfare of women and youth, and building social capital among local communities. The social 
capital benefits of the DFID pilot have encouraged the Borrower to request this sub-component 
under the loan which will give priority to proposals that benefit women and youth groups.  
7. 
Community Capacity Building:  The project will contract local consultants to facilitate a process of 
community mobilization and dialogue among local government, intended beneficiaries and other 
stakeholders in the local development process, and to help prepare proposals and finance technical 
feasibility studies for other sub-components of the loan. This process will help to identify and select 
priority infrastructure and social service investments that may be supported by activities 4-6 above.  
A
third series of activities (8-10) are intended to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Borrower to 
implement the socio-economic regeneration component. 
8. 
Social Impact Monitoring: NAD will commission annual Social Impact Monitoring and additional 
specialized studies to inform strategic planning and project review at NAD and MEC, with the 
support of the Anti-Poverty Commission (CASPIS).  
9. 
Public Information: Effective communication with local communities in mining regions and 
transparency will be crucial to successful implementation of the project. A consultant shall be 
recruited to help NAD develop its public information strategy, while service providers shall be 
contracted to develop appropriate materials for dissemination.  
10. 
Institutional Development & Staff Training:  This sub-component will include 
capacity building for NAD, PMU-SER  and RSDF, and the cost of MIS technical 
services and equipment for this component. 
 
C. Project 
Operating 
Costs 
The third component consists of the support for the operating costs of the two project implementing 
agencies namely (i) the Project Management Unit (PMU) which will manage the Mine Closure and 
Environmental component will also be responsible for consolidating project accounts; and (ii) the Project 
Management Unit for Socio-Economic Regeneration (PMU-SER) which will coordinate all the sub-
components related to Socio-Economic Regeneration (SER). Total base costs (excluding contingencies) for 
incremental operating expenses are estimated at US$6.1 million, (loan amount US$3.3 million), consisting 
of US$2.3 million in project costs ($1.2 million loan) for the PMU, and $3.8 million in project costs ($2.1 
million from loan proceeds) for the PMU-SER and partner organizations involved in the SER program.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project is located in 7 mountainous mining regions to the north and west of 
Bucharest including Jiu Valley, Brad, Zlatna, Baia de Aries, Borsa, Bucovina, and Balan . 
The 20 mines and mine processing facilities to be closed include hard coal mining, hard 
coal processing facilities, copper and polymetalic mining and mine processing facilities, 
and sulphur mining. The mine closure and environmental remediation process will 
typically include demolition and removal of mine buildings and equipment, management 
of environmental liabilities including stabilization and rehabilitation of waste rock 
dumps, rehabilitation of surface areas including tailings dams, and water treatment where 
necessary (e.g. Caliman sulphur mine). Environmental management plans (EMPs) for 
each of the sites are being prepared. Four of the proposed mine sites have a total of 11 
tailings management facilities (TMFs) which trigger the Dam Safety Safeguard.  The 
project will reduce risk of failure at these TMFs and will ensure that adequate post 
closure monitoring plans are also in place for TMFs closed under the project.  The sites to 
be closed under the project have been inspected by the Romanian experts and are being 
maintained and operated in line with Romanian regulatory requirements.  At the request 
of the Bank an independent dam specialist, who also works on the Romania Hazard Risk 
Mitigation project and is familiar with dam safety issues in Romania,  also made site 
visits and conducted a rapid risk assessment of the TMFs to be included in the project.  
The specialist considered all of the sites to be included in the project to be stable and to 
be low risk for major failure.  However, the specialist identified possible water 
management issues at 4 of the sites, which if not addressed could result in harm to the 
local ecology.  The results of the rapid risk assessment, which include recommendations 
for small works to address the water management issues at these 4 sites, were provided to 
Government  who are taking appropriate actions. 
 
The municipal infrastructure component will finance subprojects that potentially could 
involve involuntary resettlement. Land acquisition is currently governed by Law 33 
(1994), and MEC has a good track record of implementing involuntary resettlement in the 
past. The Borrower has communicated their intention to exclude any subprojects that 
require acquisition or private property from the loan. Nonetheless, it has been considered 
prudent to prepare a land expropriation/resettlement framework that describes the 
procedures to be followed in the event that during implementation involuntary 
resettlement is found to be necessary for any subproject. The land 
expropriation/resettlement framework has been adapted from that prepared for the 
Romania Transport Restructuring Project. The policy framework serves to ensure that the 
procedures to be followed for resettlement, should it ever be necessary, will also be 
consistent with Bank policy. An Environmental Framework for Municipal Infrastructure 
was also prepared.

Section II 
–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project will support physical mine closure and rehabilitation activity, including some 
Tailing Management Facilities. An infrastructure component is also included and as such 
the possibility of involuntary resettlement needs to be considered. Environmental 
Management Plans for sites to be closed and rehabilitated have been prepared as have an 
Environmental Framework for the unidentified mines and Environmental Framework and 
Involuntary Resettlement Framework for Municipal Infrastructure.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The mining restructuring entails a downsizing of the labor force by 32,300 during the 
period 2004-07. While this is not covered by the safeguard policies, they pose a moderate 
risk to achieving the project development objective. The Borrower has adequate systems 
in place to compensate redundant mining workers through generous severance payments, 
unemployment benefits and early retirement packages. The project will monitor the 
delivery of these entitlements during implementation. In addition, the project is making a 
significant investment in restoration of livelihoods through the SER sub-component, the 
impacts of which will be assessed annually. 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  8
Another impact could be triggered by land expropriation for infrastructure works. The 
Borrower has communicated their intention to exclude any subprojects from the 
municipal infrastructure sub-component that require acquisition of private property from 
the loan. Nonetheless, it has been considered prudent to prepare a policy framework that 
describes the procedures to be followed in the event that during implementation 
involuntary resettlement is found to be necessary for any subproject.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
If no action is taken to close the mine and mine processing facilities in an 
environmentally acceptable manner the environmental impacts of mining would remain 
and could worsen. Waste dumps would erode and create negative environmental impacts, 
contaminated water would be released, untreated, into the waterways and the land area 
could not be utilized for other useful economic activity. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Based on the MCMSP the Borrower capacity is considered adequate. Closure of mines is 
expected to be carried out  by  CGMC which was responsible for mine closure under 
MCSMP and has a demonstrated, reliable capability in this regard.  The Socio-economic 
regeneration activities are carried out by NAD who have also demonstrated reliable 
capacity in this regard in implementing the social mitigation activities under the 
MCSMP. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The EMPs for each site will be subject to consultation is each affected area. A Women in 
Mining workshop, to discuss and incorporate the impacts and needs of women affected 
by the project, was conducted in October 6
th
 2004 and it was decided to continue this 
process with similar decentralized workshops in 4-6 mining regions. The EMPs and 
Environmental and Involuntary Resettlement Frameworks have been publicly disclosed.
