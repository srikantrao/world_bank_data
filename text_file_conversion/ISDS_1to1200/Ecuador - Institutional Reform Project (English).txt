B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The Institutional Reform Project aims at improving efficiency and transparency in key target areas, 
through institution building and strengthening to reduce corruption and create demand and conditions for 
further reforms.  Specifically, the project is designed to: (a) improve revenue management and 
administrative control in customs to increase efficiency and transparency in revenue collection; (b) 
improve expenditure quality, reduce transaction costs, and increase transparency through the 
strengthening of internet-based public procurement and its institutional framework; and (c) launch key 
human resource management systems
 
 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
 
Customs reform: 
This component will enhance the efficiency and transparency of customs management 
to increase fiscal revenue and competitiveness.
1
 It would: (a) strengthen control and internal auditing 
systems and procedures, including greater control of merchandise and technological upgrades to detect 
VAT evasion, contraband and fraud; (b) promote greater coordination with SRI on joint auditing of large 
taxpayers; (c) improve human resource management systems to enhance the professionalism and 
                                                
 
1
 
Customs performance will be an important part for the free trade agreement and there are also significant pressures from the 
private sector to reduce transaction costs and speed up release of import merchandise (average 27 days, the highest in LAC).

autonomy of customs management, especially in internal control and oversight mechanisms and create 
stronger incentives for compliance and enforcement of sanctions; (d) improve coordination between 
customs and the Port Authority to improve customs oversight and establish port-security systems; and (e) 
establish an oversight commission on custom reforms for civil society organizations to monitor reform 
progress.  The implementation of the component will require adoption of the Customs Modernization and 
Anti-corruption Plan, the submission to the Congress of a draft Customs Restructuring Law, and the 
creation of the oversight commission. 
 
Procurement Reform : 
The component will promote greater transparency and efficiency in procurement 
by: (a) expanding the coverage of the CONTRATANET by converting it from a purely informational to a 
transactional procurement system, including the use of revised procurement measures for key clients, 
such as the National Petroleum Company; (b) link the system to the taxpayers identification database, 
incorporate sub-national procurement procedures, and initiate public sector customer training; (c) support 
the enactment of key legislation, such as a revised Procurement Law, an electronic public transactions law 
and on this basis promote an overhaul of  public procurement procedures; (d) strengthen coordination 
between various agencies involved in procurement (CCCC, State Modernization Council, Comptroller 
General’s Office, National Connectivity Council, and MEF) and institutionalize the system in one 
independent agency; and (e) provide support to the CCC and other civil society institutions to strengthen 
their advocacy role in improving transparency and greater access to information. This component will 
require creation of the independent rector procurement agency and the submission to Congress of a draft 
Procurement Law.  
 
Human resource management: 
The component would strengthen SENRES (the human 
resources agency) to enhance efficiency and transparency in the civil service by: (a) promoting 
SENRES’s internal capacity through training to administer the new personnel systems aimed at 
standardizing performance and accountability measures for civil employees; (b) developing a 
human resource management database system and a civil service registry linked to selected 
personnel procedures and to SIGEF, thereby helping contain fiscal costs; (c) strengthening of 
human resource oversight and control mechanisms by implementing the civil service reforms in 
three selected pilot URHIs; (d) promoting incentives for greater detection and control of 
corruption, e.g. through whistleblower protection; (e) executing a few selected programs to 
simplify administrative procedures; and (f)  using participatory methods to monitor and improve 
transparency and access to information, including the use of scorecards, PETS, etc.
