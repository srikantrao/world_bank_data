                           The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve access to basic irrigation services for cotton
                           farmers in Burkina Faso.
                           C. Project Description
                           Description
                           The project will have two components, the first to support the training of farmers to adopt new
                           technology and the second to support the acquisition of irrigation equipment. The project will be
                           implemented by SOFITEX, a government owned parastatal that is the largest cotton buyer and
                           processor in Burkina Faso. The project will be implemented in regions selected from the company?s
                           current area under production including Houet, KÃ©nÃ©dougou, Mouhoun, Kossi, Sourou and
                           ComoÃ© Bougouriba. Other organizations playing a key role in implementation are Ecobank, which
                           will provide financing for irrigation equipment, and the national cotton farmers association (UNPC-
                           B), which has extensive experience in delivering training to farmers.
                         Component 1 (US$900,000): Output based training for farmers. Under this component, the project
                         will provide technical capacity strengthening for 5,000 farmers on good agricultural practices for soil
                         and water, such as mulching or land forming for rainfall harvesting. Such practices are low-cost ways

                         to manage soil water to increase yields, and allow effective use of the irrigation technologies. The
                         project will also provide further training to 3,000 farmers who will benefit from irrigation equipment
                         subsidies on the operations and maintenance of equipment supported by the project. Training
                         materials will be tailored to the needs of farmers, who are often illiterate.

                         The delivery mechanism for the training, contracting of trainers and selection of beneficiaries will be
                         determined during preparation, and is expected to involve SOFITEX, the national cotton farmers
                         association (UNPC-B), which has extensive experience delivering training to farmers, and other local
                         actors who can play a long-term role in building farmer capacity for water management. In order to
                         ensure sustainability, the project will support the training of trainers.

                         All training will be output-based. A practical certification method will be defined during preparation
                         in consultation with project stakeholders. The training provider will be reimbursed for training costs
                         after independent verification by the independent verification agent (IVA) that training was carried
                         out in accordance with the rules of the project.

                         Component 2 (US$3,100,000) OBA subsidies to support acquisition of irrigation technology by
                         cotton farmers in the SOFITEX supply chain. Under this component, the project will support 2,500
                         farmers and 24 communities to acquire irrigation technology for supplementary irrigation. These
                         farmers are expected to be drawn from the set of 5,000 farmers trained under Component 1. The
                         irrigation is not meant to replace rain fed cotton farming but to help farmers supply water to the
                         cotton crop during critical dry periods when there is a high risk of crop failure, which will help build
                         resilience to climate change impacts. Technologies to be supported are likely to include:

                         a)      Improved local wells, to enhance availability of water from subsurface sources. Typical
                         wells have a limited diameter and recharge capacity; lining and enlarging the wells will significantly

                         improve performance (200-300% increased flow rates, estimated cost $ 250 - $ 400 per well)

                         b)       Motorized pumps to increase access to water. The need to manually access and carry water is
                         a major constraint to the adoption of supplementary irrigation. The introduction of locally available
                         and maintained diesel and gasoline pumps (capital cost $430 per ha plus $31 annual O&M) will
                         create greater access to irrigation water at an affordable cost. Solar powered pumps will also be
                         assessed as a way to introduce high-capital low-O&M options (Capital cost $ 16,000 / 12 ha, or $660
                         per half-hectare plot).

                         c)      Community-based solar irrigation systems. The system will allow a group of farmers within
                         a cooperative to share larger capital costs and output. Solar power reduces reliance on fossil fuels and
                         has the advantage of eliminating most of the O&M costs that have historically created problems for
                         the long-term sustainability of community-based irrigation systems.

                         d)       Improved water distribution and storage via piping and water storage structures, to improve
                         efficient utilization of water. This leverages the costly infrastructure already promoted and supplied
                         by government and donors, and will allow for organized and coordinated access to water where such
                         structures exist (costs tbc on-site).

                         Component 3 (US$400,000) Partial Risk Fund to support access to loan finance. The project is
                           proposing a partial risk fund to be accessed by the lender in the event that farmers default on their
                           loan repayment obligations to Ecobank. This would encourage the lender to make loans in what is
                           clearly a high-risk operating environment. Key risks include: fragile state with limited legal options

                           to settle disputes; absence of liquid collateral that can be provided by borrowers; and, pilot
                           investment in irrigation technology for low-income farmers not familiar with the concept. The partial
                           risk sharing structure, including limits of coverage and cover for principal payments or interest and
                           principal will be neg        otiated during preparation. The initial estimate has been set at
                           approximately 50% of the farmer contributions for equipment purchases under the project. Any funds
                           not called on from the partial risk fund shall be reallocated to Component 2.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project will be processed under O.P. 4.03 as it is a joing operation with IFC. The concept stage
                           ISDS has been processed and cleared offline.
