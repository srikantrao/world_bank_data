B.  Project Objectives  
 
The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the 
Province within a framework of fiscal responsibility as a means of supporting the return to a 
sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and increase social equity. To this end, 
the Province is prioritizing a set of interventions through a sector wide Infrastructure Program for 
the period 2004-2010 specifically aimed to: 
 
i. 
Enhance access to sewerage and urban drainage services, especially for the poorest 
living in highly vulnerable areas of the Conurbano Bonaerense.  
ii. 
Improve the provincial road network to reactivate productivity, strengthen provincial 
economy and improve regional competitiveness. 
iii. 
Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the 
Province, to implement the Infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to 
ensure convergence towards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework.  
 
The proposed project would benefit over 5 million poor people in the Province of Buenos Aires, 
through the provision of sewerage services, reduction of operating and travel time cost, 
increasing production prospects, and creating significant employment opportunities.

C.  Project Description  
 
Given the magnitude of the infrastructure needs over a long period of time and the fact that the 
Federal Government has agreed to include a US$350 million loan in the pipeline to support the 
Buenos Aires Infrastructure Program, a two-phase APL instrument is proposed.  Under this 
phased scheme, the proposal would be to maximize the overall impact, taking into account as 
many interventions as possible from the ones that already have been identified during pre-
appraisal. Following are the components identified and their sequencing in the proposed APL 
program.  
 
Component 1- Water and Sewerage (Total Estimated Cost: US$200 million of which U$ 110 
million in APL1)
:
The objective of this component is to provide access to water and especially 
sewerage services to over 1 million poor people living in areas of high vulnerability in the 
Province of Buenos Aires. 
 
Component 2 
–
Provincial Roads (Total Estimated Cost US$200 million of which U$ 110 
million in APL1)
:
This component seeks to rehabilitate high priority segments of the road 
network and implement a sustained and cost-efficient maintenance program over the entire 
network, to reduce transport costs within the Province and improve the overall competitiveness 
of the Province 
 
Component 3 – Drainage (Estimated Cost US$38 million of which US$22 million will be 
under APL1)
:
This component will finance a series of interventions in urban and periurban areas 
of the Conurbano Bonaerense to mitigate flooding caused by rainfalls of high intensity and 
relatively short duration which cause severe losses to households, especially of low income 
people, and to industries and commercial activities both directly and indirectly due to the 
interruption of transport and other services. 
 
Component 4 – Institutional Strengthening  (Estimated Cost US$12 million of which US$7 
million will be under APL1)
:
Given the sector approach of this project, the Province has 
requested a global institutional strengthening component to be managed through the Ministry of 
Economy to concentrate efforts towards building institutional capacity in the implementing 
agencies for planning, designing, contracting, executing, monitoring and evaluating the 
performance of prioritized infrastructure interventions and adequately manage the Province’s 
assets. This component will provide support to the Provincial Road Department, the Public 
Works Sub secretary, the Public Services Sub secretary, and the Environmental Sub secretary, to 
finance training activities and specific technical assistances to perform strategic studies in the 
above related areas. 
 
Component 5 
–
Building Strategic Infrastructure Planning Instruments (Estimated Cost 
US$16 million of which US$9 million will be under APL1)
:
This component, also to be 
managed by the Ministry of Economy, will provide support to the Province to establish a 
strategic framework for the development of key infrastructure projects, serving as a planning tool 
to anticipate future requirements, prepare new projects and assess economic impacts from 
identified investment projects, in particular on poverty reduction targets and contribution to 
Page  3
economic growth. This component will finance feasibility studies, project designs, economic 
impact studies, and so on.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The project team and the Provincial Government are assessing the capacity of the institutions 
that would be involved in order to establish the project implementation arrangements and 
sustainability issues.  The Team expects to have a definition of this issue before appraisal.

Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01) 
The Program does not foresee significant environmental impacts that could 
jeopardize the natural environment of its area of influence. However, it is has 
been anticipated temporal and direct impacts that need to be prevented, mitigated 
and compensated, to ensure the environmental sustainability of the Program. An 
Environmental Assessment will be prepared and disclosed prior to appraisal. A 
Strategic Environmental Report will be prepared for the sewerage interventions, 
taking into account available and relevant studies, to define an environmental 
management plan for the project and also identify possible strategic issues, which 
although might go beyond the proposed interventions, they could be addressed in 
the course of project implementation to strengthen and broaden the sector 
environmental agenda. Road works will be developed along existing right-of-
ways, implying no significant physical changes. Potential risks can be easily 
identified and mitigation measures are available. The Guidelines for Addressing 
Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues in Roads Financing Projects is being 
applied, to perform an environmental evaluation of each project to be included in 
the Program, and on that basis, enable the measurement of potential 
environmental and social risks. Environmental Assessments for all projects to be 
financed under the drainage component will be prepared.

III.  AGREEMENTS REACHED ON SAFEGUARDS AT PCN REVIEW 
 
Based on the project’s scope, the environmental assessment category recommended by QAT is 
B.  
 
A
Strategic Environmental Report will be prepared for the sewerage interventions, taking into 
account available and relevant studies, to define an environmental management plan for the 
project and also identify possible strategic issues, which although might go beyond the proposed 
interventions, they could be addressed in the course of project implementation to strengthen and 
broaden the sector environmental agenda.        
 
Treatment plants that are justified from a technical, economical and environmental viewpoint 
may be considered to be financed by the project, without altering the environmental category of 
the project.   In this respect, building on the Strategic Environmental Assessment, the project 
could consider some activities (studies/institutional measures to review existing legal framework, 
strengthen regulatory bodies) to help in removing existing constraints, improving current 
environmental/sectoral policies and strategies, and furthering/broadening the environmental 
agenda during project implementation. 
 
IV.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
The target date for preparing the PAD-stage ISDS July 1, 2004 
 
The following actions have been identified during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them: 
 
·
Preparing an Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) for the sewerage 
interventions within the Conurbano Bonaerense. For this purpose, the 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas
 
Page  5
Environmental analysis prepared by the Bank in the Water Sector Reform 
Program in 1999 will be considered, taking into account the tools that were 
developed under this program. The SEA should be completed before appraisal. 
 
·
Performing an environmental evaluation of each project to be financed under the 
road component applying the Guidelines for Addressing Environmental and 
Social Safeguard Issues in Roads Financing Projects, improving the institutional 
level of the environmental unit that currently is a working group within the 
Provincial Road Agency, and updating the Road Environmental Guidelines that 
are currently being used under the Provincial Roads Project.  
 
·
Preparing Environmental Assessments for all projects to be financed under the 
drainage component and presenting Management Plans for the Basins of the 
Matanza and Reconquista Rivers.  
 
·
According to the new guidelines, all infrastructure projects should trigger the 
cultural property policy.  Given this, even though there is no expectation that 
cultural property is in the project area, the Environmental Assessment would set 
forth "chance find" procedures in the case that such property is encountered.  
 
·
In order to comply with the environmental legislation, the implementing agencies 
need to coordinate with the environmental authority (Sub Secretaria de Política 
Ambiental de la Provincia) to fulfill environmental requirements.  
 
·
The Team has advised the Government of the Province of Buenos Aires on the 
need to notify the Government of Uruguay, about the proposed sewerage projects 
as part of the International Waterways Safeguard provisions.
