2. Project Objectives:
The project's development objectives are:
    (i)      to contribute to improvement of security through disarmament and demobilization of
             up to 11,000 combatants;

    (ii)     to support social reintegration through rehabilitation of social infrastructure and
             conflict management and reconciliation;

    (iii)    to support economic reintegration through income generating activities to ex-
             combatants

3. Project Description:
The project is based on the "Programme National de Désarmement, Demobilisation, et de Ré-
insertion" (PNDDR), adopted by the Government on December 31, 2004. It should also be read



                                                                                                   1

in conjunction with a "Lettre de Politique Générale de Désarmement , de Démobilisation et de
Réinsertion" that was submitted in November 2003. The "Programme National" provides a
broad strategy for the consolidation of stability with several components that will be funded
through parallel means. The program ensures a comprehensive approach that would take into
account both disarmament, certain vulnerable groups, demobilization and reintegration aspects as
well as security sector reform and the promotion of a culture of peace. The program approach
will be accompanied by a Joint Operations Plan (JOP) to reflect its multi-dimensional nature.
In particular, UNDP has received a EURO 2 million grant from the European Commission for a
disarmament and community reintegration program that will be implemented under the Program.

The proposed project would cover only those activities in the "Plan National" that fall within
MDRP and World Bank criteria, as follows:
                Demobilization and reintegration of 25,000 to 30,000 of mainly adult ex-
                combatants in three key groups (about 60% of overall funds):
                    i. Demobilization and reintegration of combatants in the Pool region
                       (5,000); this includes up to 1,500 child soldiers;
                   ii. Reintegration of ex-combatants who do no longer belong to any militia
                       and have "auto-demobilized", but have access to arms and remain
                       unemployed (19,000);
                  iii. Demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants who had been
                       temporarily incorporated into the army for reasons of stability and who
                       will shortly be demobilized as part of security reform efforts (6,000);
                Support to communities where ex-combatants are present (about 10% of overall
                funds).
                Activities, both local and national, aimed at facilitating the social reinsertion of
                ex-combatants through reconciliation events, the promotion of a culture of peace,
                and the strengthening of traditional and other conflict resolution mechanisms.
                (about 2% of overall funds).

Individual benefits are based on a menu of choices that include a wide variety of activities in
commerce, services and agriculture, for which micro-grants will be made available.                 Ex-
combatants will need to prepare a short proposal of how they intend to use their benefits, which
is designed to encourage individual responsibility. At the same time, beneficiaries will also
receive the appropriate guidance by agencies specifically recruited for that purpose. Expected
income generation activities include fishery, agriculture and livestock activities such as vegetable
gardens, chicken and goat breeding, and artisan fishing; small secondary sector activities such as
husking, shelling, mills, preparation and treatment of vegetables and fish products, production
and sale of dairy products; professions in skin and textiles, metal works; and service professions
such as repair of motorbikes and bikes, construction and maintenance, cafeterias, restaurants,
hairdressing, photolabs and kiosks.

Community projects will take the form of infrastructure repair, notably in the education and
health sectors. Projects include schools, health posts, sanitation and sewage facilities, stocking,
environmental protection projects such as anti-erosion projects, terracing, and treeplanting.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
Territory of the Republic of Congo. This is a national project whose activities will focus on small
scale infrastructure and employment generation in rural and urban areas. All small scale
infrastructure will be in accordance with existing plans and standards. Employment generation
will be in areas where ex combatants are resident, and based on an assessment of skills,
feasibility, and community impact. All financing will be pre-screened for environmental impact
and appropriate mitigation measures will be applied.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The phased and widely dispersed reintegration of 25-30,000 ex-combatants into civilian life is
expected to be environmentally neutral. Possibly, environmental and social issues could occur
in the reintegration activities through individual micro projects and community infrastructure.
(i) Reintegration activities may, if not well managed, cause adverse impacts such as overgrazing,
increased use of pesticides, and soil degradation through livestock and agriculture projects, as
well as overfishing and deforestation.
(ii) Rehabilitation of infrastructure could, if not well managed, cause deforestation by
uncontrolled use of wood for construction, soil degradation and erosion, and water-transferable
diseases through ill-managed sanitary facilities.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:
 N/A




                                                                                                   3

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

The program is expected to be classified as environmental category B, as it includes support to
income-generating activities. Although no adverse environmental impacts are expected,
preventive mitigation measures are in place. Building on lessons from other reintegration
programs for displaced persons and ex-combatants, the program contains a number of specific
elements to identify social and environmental risks and devise appropriate mitigation measures.
These procedures and measures are elaborated in the Environmental and Social Screening
Procedures developed for the Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program
(MDRP) by the Africa Region's Social and Environmental Safeguards unit (ASPEN) in
collaboration with the MDRP Secretariat. These procedures constitute a screening mechanism
for all MDRP projects, and are integrated in the program implementation manual through
specific selection criteria and mitigation measures. Furthermore, adequate arrangements for
medical waste disposal of HIV/AIDS testing materials will be included in the Program
Implementation Manual.

Based on their past experience with a similar project, and work on the framework, the borrower
has sufficient capacity to plan and implement these measures.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

The RCERP will seek to promote participatory social and environmental monitoring. Annual
evaluations will include an assessment of, among others: the procedures to access land; the
occurrence of involuntary displacement or resettlement; the degree of community acceptance;
the existence of discrimination on the basis of gender or previous military affiliation; the level of
personal security of ex-combatants; the inclusion of Ninja ex-combatants in the program's
activities; the level of criminal activities undertaken by ex-combatants; and the impact of
reintegration on an ex-combatant's family members. These evaluations will help to identify
social and environmental impacts, determine the appropriateness of procedures and processes,
and make recommendations for improvements where necessary.

The MDRP Environmental and Social Screening Procedures discussed above will be publicly
disclosed at effectiveness all over the territory and disseminated through national sensitization
campaigns by the High Commissariat for the Reintegration of Ex Combatants nationally and
from its seven provincial offices.
