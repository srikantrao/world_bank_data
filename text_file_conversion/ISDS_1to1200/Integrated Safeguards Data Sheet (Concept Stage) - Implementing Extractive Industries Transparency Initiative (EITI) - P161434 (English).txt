                           The proposed DO is to support the Dominican Republic achieve Extractive Industries Transparency
                           Initiative (EITI) Compliant country status by 2018, in accordance to EITI Standard 2016.
                           C. Project Description
                           The grant would support the following activities, identified in the Dominican Republic's EITI Work
                           plan for 2015-2017:

                           a) Preparation of the first EITI Report covering 2014-2015

                           This activity will consist in financing the hiring of a consultancy firm to prepare the first EITI report,
                           which among other things will require performing the quality control of the information on
                           extractives sector companies provided by the DR-EITI National Commission to ensure consistency
                           with the EITI Standard as well as reconciling payments made by mining and oil companies to the
                           GoDR and receipts by the GoDR. In addition, this activity will finance workshops for the members
                           of Dominican Republic's EITI multi-stakeholder group to discuss the EITI National Report to ensure
                           that government, companies and civil society are actively engaged.

                           Expected Results: (i) The Dominican Republic's EITI National Report reflects EITI Standard
                           requirements; and (ii) government, companies and civil society were actively engaged in the process
                           of report preparation.
                           Expected Outcome: A strengthened oversight of the extractives sector revenues along the value

                           Transparency Initiative (EITI)

                           This activity will include support for the i) design and implementation of outreach activities that will
                           communicate/disseminate the merits of transparency of extractives revenues and of the EITI process
                           in the Dominican Republic (includes postings in government websites, newspaper articles, TV and
                           radio spots); ii) publishing and dissemination of the results of the EITI National Report and related
                           materials in Spanish; iii) enhancing the Dominican Republic EITI webpage; iv) engagement of local
                           communities on the EITI process and transparency of extractives revenues by civil society
                           organizations.

                           Expected Result: Effective ongoing communication and outreach on the EITI National Report and
                           transparency of extractives revenues.
                           Expected Outcome: Greater awareness of citizens regarding mining sector issues as well as the EITI
