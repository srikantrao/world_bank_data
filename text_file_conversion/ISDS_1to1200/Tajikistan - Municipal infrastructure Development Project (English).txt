II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project will not have any significant or irreversible environmental impacts and is 
classified as Environmental category B. Short term impacts will be minimized by proper 
planning and application of preventative measures and mitigated by curative actions after 
construction is completed.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
There are no indirect or long term measures anticipated due to future activities in the 
project area.  The project may support activities that take place near trans-boundary 
waterways.  However, the project was granted an exception from notifying the riparians, 
since the proposed activities will not modify nor increase the volume of water abstraction 
from the surface or ground water reservoirs, nor affect the rights of other users.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
There are no alternative project options.  The project will involve rehabilitation of 
existing infrastructure assets only.  The project will not entail  land acquisition or 
temporary or permanent relocation, or adverse impacts on livelihoods. Adverse impacts 
on livelihoods will be avoided by providing alternative access routes if necessary, and 
phasing construction to minimize disruption.    
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Borrower will prepare an Environmental Management Plan for each investment, 
detailing likely impacts (including the social ones) and the mitigation measures. 
Provisions for Environmental screening will be included in the Operational Manual and 
the subproject specific EMPs.  Investments will also need to obtain clearances as per 
Tajikistan national legislation.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The Key stakeholders are KMK, a central government utility agency, local 
municipalities, and the beneficiaries.  As part of the social assessment consultations are 
being carried out with consumers to determine their needs and ensure that they are taken 
into account in project design.  Periodic consultations will continue during project 
implementation and after project completion to determine the level of beneficiary 
satisfaction with the project and its impact. The project-wide EMP was discussed at 
public consultation meeting.
