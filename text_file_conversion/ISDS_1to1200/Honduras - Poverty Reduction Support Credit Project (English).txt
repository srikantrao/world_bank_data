B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Bank support through programmatic lending will provide balance of payments assistance to 
support a medium-term program of policy and institutional reforms aimed at accelerating 
implementation of the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
In line with the pillars of Honduras’ PRSP and, in particular, the medium-term priorities 
identified in the PRSP and PRSP-PR, the proposed PRSC aims to support Government efforts to: 
 
• 
Accelerate 
pro-poor growth
, via support for reforms aimed at increasing competitiveness 
and maximizing the potential for new investment and employment-creation for men and 
women in both urban and rural areas in the wake of  new regional and international 
agreements, in particular, the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).

• 
Increase the impact and efficiency of resources devoted to 
human development and social 
protection
, with a focus on deconcentration of responsibilities for service provision and 
increased empowerment of beneficiaries of key services. 
 
• 
Increase the medium- and long-term sustainability of poverty reduction initiatives 
through policy and institutional reforms geared to strengthening 
governance and public 
sector management
 and improving management of the 
environment
, particularly 
Honduras’ extensive protected areas. 
 
• 
In addition, the PRSC will support the Government’s initiatives to systematize 
consultation processes around the poverty reduction strategy and strengthen monitoring 
and evaluation at national and community levels.
