A.2. Project Objectives
The objective of the project is to achieve sustained and growing increases in energy efficiency in residential
buildings in China's cold and severe cold regions and in the heating systems which supply them.
A.3. Project Description
The proposed GEF project is the focal point of a broader heat reform and building energy efficiency
program involving World Bank assistance. The other main part of this program is a series of Bank policy
studies, primarily on implementation options for heat reform. The program could also involve additional
donor support and is coordinated with ongoing international assistance mobilized by the Government to
support its heat reform and building energy efficiency program.
The project is a national-level project, including three components: (a) demonstration of the integration of
improved energy efficiency in residential buildings with heat supply system modernization and heat pricing
and billing reform in Tianjin Municipality, (b) technical assistance3 support for the Min9istry of
Construction (MOC) for national policy development and project implementation; and (c) replication of the
integrated approach adopted in Tianjin in 4-6 other northern cities.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The project will support implementation of comprehensive heat reform and building energy efficiency
programs in 5-7 Chinese cities. The only city firmly identified prior to presentation to the Bank's Board
will be Tianjin Municipality, which is a city of provincial rank located 150 km southeast of Beijing.
The project's demonstration investment sub components in Tianjin and other northern cities ($13 million),
involve partial financing of energy efficiency equipment and measures(e.g., improved insulation and
windows, heat metering equipment, thermal control valves, improved piping and radiators, energy-
efficiency improvements in heat generating facilities, and adoption of variable-flow capability and
improved substation configurations in district heating systems). The balance of GEF financing ($5 million
will support technical assistance and certain incremental operating costs of the Project Management
Office.

Section 11 - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D. 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The GEF will finance a portion of the incremental costs of energy efficiency measures and equipment in
housing developments and their associated heating plants and systems. Except for one project in Tianjin,
which is expected to be appraised and approved prior to presentation of the overall GEF project to the
World Bank's Board, these investment subprojects will be prepared, appraised by MOC and the Bank, and
approved during the course of project implementation. Environmental impacts of these investments are
expected to be strongly positive. No land acquisition or resettlement is expected to be required for most, if
not all of the project's energy efficiency investment subprojects. However, all investment subprojects will
be screened, according to procedures agreed in the project's Environmental and Social Safeguards
Frameworks, to ascertain any potential for negative environmental impacts, land acquisition, involuntary
resettlement or ethnic minority impacts, and if such exist, analysis and mitigation of such impacts
according to World Bank policies. The screening procedures defined in the two project Safeguards
Frameworks will determine if Environmental Impact Assessments, Resettlement Action Plans or Ethnic
Minority Development Plans are required for any specific investment subprojects, and subsequent Bank
approval requirements.
The project's energy efficiency investments will be hosted in broader housing complex and heating
systems developments, which will typically involve investments of about 100 times the level of GEF
incremental cost financing. These developments have been planned and will proceed regardless of Bank
and GEF involvement, and in accordance with relevant Chinese regulations. Due diligence reporting of
any safeguards issues associated with these developments also is required for all subprojects, and the
specific requirements for this due-diligence reporting is described in the agreed two project Safeguards
Frameworks. The Social Safeguards Framework requires due-diligence reporting, satisfactory to MOC and
the Bank, which includes description of all land acquisition, resettlement or ethnic minority impacts
associated with the broader developments, provides evidence that all national and local laws and
regulations have been strictly followed, and identify any relevant issues. The Environmental Safeguards
Framework requires due-diligence reporting, satisfactory to MOC and the Bank, which includes description
of any negative environmental impacts associated with the broader developments, provides evidence that
all national and local laws and regulations have been strictly followed, and identifies any relevant issues.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area.
See above.
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower, through the Ministry of Construction, has prepared, with Bank assistance, a Social
Safeguards Framework document and an Environmental Framework Document, both dated December 23,
2004, and submitted by MOC to the Bank on January 12, 2005. The Environmental Safeguards Specialist
and the Social Safeguards Specialist of the project team have both reviewed these documents, respectively,
and found them satisfactory. MOC's PMO will have primary responsibility to ensure that these
Frameworks are properly applied by investment subproject sponsors, and both MOC and the Bank must
review and approve the safeguards reports (including due-diligence reports) for all subprojects as part of
the subproject appraisal and approval process.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on



safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Stakeholder consultations requirements will follow World Bank requirements in cases where EJAs, RAPs
or EMDPs are required, as a result of the screening process of the project Safeguard Frameworks.
Stakeholder consultations requirements for broader, associated developments hosting the project's energy
efficiency investments will follow Chinese national and local regulations and requirements.
