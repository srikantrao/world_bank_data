                           B. Project Objectives
                           The project development objective is to improve access to economic opportunities derived from
                           more sustainable management of agricultural resources in selected lagging regions of Tunisia.

                           Direct beneficiaries of the project will be the rural communities in the NW and CW regions of
                           Tunisia, which will benefit from a range of initiatives aimed at improving their asset-based
                           livelihoods through different capacity building initiatives and investments (on local natural, physical,
                           human, and social capital). These communities represent a population of about 250,000 rural
                           households (about 1.5 million people), Women constitute 51 percent of these beneficiaries, and youth
                           (age category 15-29) are about 25 percent (i.e., about 400,000 people).
                           A number of national and regional institutions will also indirectly benefit from the project. They will
                         benefit from capacity building initiatives as well as the effects of improvements of the legal and
                         institutional environment and regulations, namely the following: (i) at national level, this include key
                         MARHP directorates and agencies (particularly DGFIOP, DGF, DGAP, DGPA, DGIA➢❨¦) and
Public Disclosure Copy




                         sectoral ministerial departments; (ii) at regional level, CRDAs and regional institutions, as well as
                         different ranches of sectoral ministerial departments.
                         C. Project Description
                         A. Concept
                         The integrated landscape management approach adopted by the Project fully recognize the
                         interdependence between agricultural value chains and natural resources. Rural households➢❨
                         incomes will be increased within a comprehensive paradigm which strengthens resilience and
                         sustainability. This approach will draw on the successful Leader program of the European
                         Commission for integrated rural development in lagging regions which empowers local actors to
                         develop an area by capitalizing on its endogenous development potential and on public-private
                         partnerships.

                         PROJECT DESCRIPTION
                         The project will be implemented through 4 interrelated components: Component 1 will focus on
                         territorial development planning and investment in improving landscape management; component 2
                         focuses on VC development; and component 3 on addressing policies and barriers to (i) improved
                         landscape management, (ii) income generation and integration of rural households into agricultural
                         based VCs. The last component is related to the project management.

                         COMPONENT 1: Strengthening integrated landscape management (ILM) approach (US$ 50
                         Million)

                         This component will include two complementary sets of activities focusing on: (i) Territorial
                         Development Planning and capacity-building for integrated landscape management implementation,
                         including the sustainable management of natural resources; and (ii) implementation of ILDPs.

                         Sub-component 1.1. Territorial Development Planning. This sub-component will involve the
                         following inter-dependent activities:
                         a.       Information management and knowledge creation: Strategic planning for integrated
                         landscape management including impacts and vulnerability to climate change require accurate
                         information and database on agricultural resources. The project will support the following activities
                         which will concern the whole country and for which TORs and / or DAO will be ready at negotiation
                         stage: (i) establishment of the national forest and rangelands inventory; (ii) elaboration of a national
                         restoration (afforestation) plan; (iii) completion of land cover and soils potential maps at appropriate
                         scales; (iv) Development / update of integrated forest and rangeland co-management plans; (v)
                         Development of agricultural management information and monitoring systems, including the
                         monitoring of environmental services of forests and rangelands, land use changes, and (vi) the
                         development of an Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system.
                         b.       Mobilization and awareness building: In parallel of the above activities, and specifically in
                         the NW and CW regions, this sub-component will support mobilization and awareness activities to
                         generate the demand for the formation of Multi-Sectoral Partners Groups (MSPGs) which will
                         effectively lead the planning process at landscape level, elaborate landscape development plans, and
                         guide their implementation and monitoring. MSPGs will be created with appropriate statutes that
                         ensure adequate representation for the various interest groups, and securing transparency in decision
                         making. Once in place, MSPGs technical and managerial capacities will be strengthened through
                         qualified consultants to be hired at the project effectiveness.
                         c.       Once the MSPG is created, it would prepare a participatory Integrated Landscape
                         Development Plans (ILDP). The planning process will be streamlined with the annual investment

                         planning process currently undertaken by the local governments. The plan examines the strengths,
                         weaknesses, opportunities and threats faced by the community within its identified territory and
                         outlines the types of actions and VCs to be developed and supported to address the weaknesses a nd
                         threats and exploit the strengths and opportunities.

                         Sub-component 1.2: ILDPs Implementation. This sub-component will support the implementation of
                         ILDPs produced in alignment with the annual local government investment plans through a
                         conditional transfer co-financing grants linked to the LUs. The Project Operation Manual (POM) ➢❨
                         to be prepared before negotiations ➢❨ will spell out funding mechanisms, eligible investments,
                         eligible project promoters, performance criteria to access to funds, and the like. Activities to be
                         supported by this sub-component are exclusively related to forestry, agriculture and rangelands
                         management, and small infrastructure. As the participatory approach to elaborate ILDPs is an
                         extensive process, priority investments (for the first years) will be drawn from thelocal development
                         plans elaborated under PNO4 and PGRN2 projects, and the preliminary ILDPs process elaborated
                         before appraisal and during project implementation. Investments will focus on:

                         a.      Implementation of a variety of climate-smart agriculture practices which could include: (i)
                         integrated soil fertility management techniques; (ii) conservation tillage; (iii) soil, water and nutrient
                         management along with agroforestry; (iv) techniques to build soil organic matter (to increase
                         agriculture resilience to climate change); and (v) livestock husbandry and livestock diversification.

                         b.       Implementation of a variety of sustainable forests rangeland management activities such as:
                         afforestation/reforestation activities; landscape restoration works; natural regeneration; rangeland
                         seeding; rehabilitation of aromatic and medicinal plants; and maintenance of new plantations as well
                         as thinning and pruning of forests combined with introduction of forest fire protection activities and

                         biodiversity measures. Where supported by the community, forest and rangeland certification
                         activities could underpin the developments.

                         For forests and rangelands, in order to allow local population and private actors to co-manage forests
                         and rangelands resources, a phased approach was agreed with the MARHP. Under the first phase, a
                         co-management model ➢❨ Community Forestry and Rangeland Management Agreement (CFRMA)
                         ➢❨ defining the roles and responsibilities of the forestry administration and local communities (e.g.,
                         forestry user groups), will be finalized before appraisal, signed by Negotiations, and piloted during
                         the first two years of the project in 10 selected Landscape Units (LUs). The second phase would roll
                         out the co-management of forests and rangelands in the whole North-West and Center-West Regions.
                         MARHP is committed to improve the forest code, as requested under the new five year development
                         plan, but wants to benefit from lessons of experience before a national roll-out to field-test the model
                         and learn from experience. During this pilot phase, provisions to improve the forestry code will be
                         developed based on an in-depth review of the legal framework governing natural resources (see
                         component 3.1).

                         COMPONENT 2. Strengthening agricultural value chains (US$35 million)

                         This subcomponent would support investments and job creation in agricultural value chains by
                         providing financial and non-financial services to targeted beneficiaries (Micro, Small, and Medium
                         Enterprises ➢❨ MSMEs - including individual producers and self-employed; user groups). Support
                         is provided through an MSME development Platform, which builds on the value chain development
                         task-force created in CEPEX by the Third Export Development Project (EDP-3). This platform will
Public Disclosure Copy




                         contain two components:

                         Sub-component 2.1. Supporting Services for Inclusive Entrepreneurship in Value Chains
                         development. The aim of this subcomponent is to provide Enterprise Support Services (ESSs) to
                         MSMEs (including individual producers and farmers) and improve market orientation and exchanges
                         using participatory mechanisms. The platform will identify, develop, and/or support the growth of
                         existing MSMEs whose activities are based on agricultural products already existing in the targeted
                         regions. The package of ESS would vary depending on the type of business and the characteristics of
                         the beneficiaries but would include the following outputs: (a) business-to-business networking and
                         cluster development based on strategic market orientation and analysis; (b) Training, in business
                         planning and development, (c) advisory and mentoring services, (d) assistance in accessing finance.

                         Sub -component 2.2. Smart MSMEs co-financing to integrate growing value chains. The objective of
                         this subcomponent is to provide co-financing to MSMEs for the implementation of business plans
                         resulting from sub-component 2.1. In order to secure efficient and transparent financing, the project
                         will channel grants through the Productivity and Growth Fund (PGF) to selected business-plans by
                         associations of farmers and/or firms. The PGF will be managed internally by the ministry of
                         agriculture, and a dedicated operations manual will be developed at appraisal stage.

                         Types of investments would include advisory and mentoring services, the purchase of collective
                         services that provide high added value to a wide range of vulnerable and atomized beneficiaries (e.g.
                         cold chain services for individual farmers of fresh produce), equipment (including information
                         technology), small works (like rehabilitation of existing facilities), and needed common-good
                         technical infrastructure. Other activities aimed to catalyze collaboration among entrepreneurs to
                         access skills, equipment, training or other value-addition services that have been identified through
                         component 2.1, and demonstrate the incremental returns to the entire value chain, can also be co-

                         financed by the PGF.

                         The competitive selection process of the PGF will be open to applicants using clear eligibility criteria
                         (including the ability to create local jobs), and funds will be allocated in compliance with Bank
                         procurement procedures. Beneficiaries could also be local entrepreneurs and reputable distribution
                         partners who provide key services missing from a value chain (e.g. logistics firms, retailers,
                         international exporters) and who could demonstrate the ability to help local entrepreneurs/MSMEs
                         develop their integration in the value chain and create jobs and value added locally.

                         COMPONENT 3. Strengthening institutional and legal frameworks (US$ 8 million)

                         During the project preparation phase, and throughout the rollout of the various value chain
                         development initiatives (through public private dialogue) supported by this project, an evaluation of
                         the legal and institutional frameworks governing agriculture and natural resources will identify key
                         strengths and weaknesses. Activities of this component seek to strengthen accordingly the legal and
                         institutional frameworks governing agricultural resources.

                         Sub-component 3.1. Strengthening the legal framework. Project activities will support specific
                         initiatives aimed at: (i) Conducting in-depth analyses of current legislation governing natural
                         resources (forestry code, water code, soils code, land tenure code, public-private partnership (PPP)
                         code, and other agribusiness related regulations) and identifying complementarities and
                         inconsistencies among them; (ii) Assessing the legal soundness of the co-management model
                         established in the 10 targeted LUs (sub-component 1.1), before replicating it; (iii) Proposing to the

                         government simple and viable alternatives aimed to adjust agricultural regulatory framework, and in
                         particular the forestry code and some key national regulations and procedures that have a direct
                         impact on the ways farmers and MSMEs participate in decision-making process, and access to
                         finance and use sustainably their natural resources.

                         Sub-component 3.2. Strengthening the MARHP institutional framework. Specific activities of the
                         sub-component will aim at improving in a targeted fashion the organizational framework of the
                         MARHP general directorates and CRDAs, mainly services governing agriculture and natural
                         resources, to ensure better coordination, complementarity, consistency and quality. Learning from
                         pilot activities rewarding farmers for improved agricultural practices with area based payments as
                         intended under the project, in so far as endorsed by government, policy papers and draft regulation,
                         including payment mechanism design could be introduced to eventually roll-out adopted policies
                         throughout the project area or nationally. Appropriate mechanisms and procedures will be defined
                         and put in place in order to steer the entire process and monitor its implementation and performance,
                         and ensure a smooth translation of strategic objectives into action.

                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will be implemented in different sites in the North west and center west regions. The
                         project sites will be identified during project preparation, according to different criteria, such as
                         poverty, environmental degradation, food insecurity, vulnerability to severe weather conditions and
                         the willingness and adherence of local population and private stakeholders to promote sustainable
                         participative management approach and innovative economic activities. The main activities will
                         focus on developing added value chains and restoring degraded forests and rangelands. It will be
                         prepared in complementarity with the upcoming irrigation project

                         The MARHP will be responsible for project implementation. A National Steering Committee
                         (ComitÃ© de Pilotage du Projet, CPP) chaired by the Minister of MARHP and made up of members
                         from other concerned ministries, civil society and private sector representatives, will ensure the
                         consistency of the project with national sectoral policies and programs, and provide validation of the
                         Project Operations Manual (POM), annual work plans and budgets, and progress reports. At regional
                         level, a Regional Coordination Committee (CRCP, ComitÃ© regional de Coordination du Projet)
                         will ensure adequate coordination of regional stakeholders: chaired by the President of the Regional
                         Council and made up of representatives of key sectoral institutions, local authorities, socio-
                         professional organizations and private sector, the CRCP will create necessary synergies at regional
                         level to facilitate and accelerate the implementation of project activities and ensure consistency and
                         complementarity with other interventions; it will also validate ILDPs at LU level, and supervise their
                         implementation.

                         A Management by Objectives Unit (UGO, UnitÃ© de Gestion par Objectifs), established within
                         DGFIOP, will coordinate and monitor all the project activities, organize NCS meetings, and ensure
                         proper M&E activities. This unit will be responsible for overall project fiduciary oversight including
                         financial management, disbursement and procurement. Particularly, it will coordinate all
                         procurement of the Project, contracts, and quality-control, and establish conventions with the
                         institutions involved in the implementation of the components and sub-components of the Project.
                           UGO will be made up of qualified staff from the PGRN2 project and DGF (selected on the bases of
                           agreed ToRs and nominated after Bank approval): a Director; two Deputy Directors; Procurement
                           specialist; and Financial management specialist. The UGO will also benefit from full or part-time

                           Information system SESAME tool. This system has been successfully implemented in the PGRN2
                           project and will allow overall project implementation monitoring (procurement, financial
                           management, disbursements, M&E). SESAMA is a software linked to the national public system for
                           budget execution, ADEB, and it is usable at both central and local levels.. At regional level, project
                           implementation will be coordinated and supervised by CRDAs (particularly its Planning and Rural
                           Development Unit ➢❨ Division de Planification et DÃ©veloppement rural) including regional staff
                           of the PGRN2.
