                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The development objective of this grant is to increase availability of high quality training modules on
                           water diplomacy and basin governance related to cooperative water governance.
                           C. Project Description
                           The grant will support the design of short training modules and curriculum in water diplomacy and
                           basin governance—for uptake by participating universities and other institutions for long-term
                           teaching of the topics. Firstly, a project advisory group will be constituted, consisting of
                           representatives from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, IUCN, the World Bank and
                           academic institutions, to oversee curriculum development. The short training modules will then be
                           authored and finalized for pilot testing. Focus institutions will be identified in India and Bangladesh
                           to run the modules. The modules will then be piloted through the focus institutions and piloted at a
                           regional workshop with participation from other countries in the region. The modules will finally be
                           fine-tuned based on inputs received during the national and regional level workshops and through
                         consultations with experts and institutions stationed in South Asia. At the closing of the grant, the
                         modules/curriculum will be ready for roll-out and institutionalization across the region (into
                         government training agencies and academic programs in universities).

                         The training modules/curriculum will aim to build capacity at the policy and technical levels, with a
                         focus on transboundary water governance and hydro-diplomacy at the basin and sub-basin levels for
                         policymakers, water agency technical staff, and students. With a goal to institutionalize and ensure
                         sustainability of teaching on these subjects, the modules/curriculum will support current and future
                         decision makers to identify and consider transboundary and cooperative water governance as a policy
                         option, and to negotiate and handle sensitive inter- and intra-state water resources issues in bilateral
                         and multilateral contexts. Importantly, the content will relate water cooperation to cooperation in
                         other areas, such as electricity, navigation, national security, creation of economic corridors, and jobs
                         growth to facilitate an environment of overall meaningful cooperation in the Indus, Ganges, and
                         Brahmaputra basins.

                         Component 1: Development of Training Modules/Curriculum (US$122,000)
                         Seven content modules will be developed by a team of ten authors from at least two countries in the
                         South Asia region. Lecture notes, case studies, presentations, role-plays, individual and group
                         exercises, films, background reference material, and interaction with those who have carried out
                         negotiations on water will enrich the content of each module. Further refinements will be made to the
                         module after pilot testing workshops. The output of this component will comprise of designed
                         curriculum, training modules and a basic e-module on the topics of water diplomacy and basin
                         governance for uptake by participating universities and other institutions for long-term teaching of
                         the topics.

                         Component 2: Pilot Testing of Modules (US$ 215,000)
                         The modules will be pilot tested in India and Bangladesh, and at a regional workshop, to select
                         policymakers and practitioners for their utility and effectiveness before rollout. The modules will
                         then be presented to institutions from other countries of the region for potential future uptake and

                         teaching. Support will be provided to agencies and academic institutions to adapt and integrate the
                         short training modules into long-term running courses. The outputs of this component are national
                         and regional pilot testing workshops on training module/curriculum content.

                         Component 3: Program Management and Dissemination (US$83,000 from SAWI + US$ 74,800
                         from IUCN)
                         This component will fund dissemination of course material and information about available training
                         programs, including through an e-discussion forum; as well as management of the implementation of
                         this regional grant through various IUCN country offices.
