A.2. Project Objectives: 
The objective of the Poverty Reduction Technical Assistance Credit (PRSTAC) is to 
assist the Government of Honduras in improving its institutional capacity in the areas of 
planning, public expenditure management, accountability, public administration, public 
service delivery, and participatory monitoring, thereby facilitating implementation of the 
PRSP. 
 
The PRSTAC is designed to support the implementation of reforms advanced in the PRSC. The 
Government’s institutional framework needs to overcome weaknesses that are undermining PRSP 
implementation. Specifically, the PRSTAC’s development objectives are to: (i) develop the Government’s 
capacity to manage, monitor, evaluate and improve PRS implementation by giving all stakeholders access 
to effective mechanisms for the design and control of the government’s poverty reduction programs; (ii) 
support the implementation of the Public Human Resource Reform thereby ensuring a more equitable 
working environment with better performance incentives and improved civil service quality, and improve 
public service management and delivery in key economic and social sectors; and (iii) strengthen the 
Government’s fiscal, financial and fiduciary management, resulting in a more accurate, timely, relevant and 
transparent public sector.

A.3. Project Description 
The proposed PRSTAC would constitute a US$X million operation comprised of an IDA 
credit of US$10 million, supplemented by co-financing from the Government of Sweden 
in the amount of US$X million and from the Government of United Kingdom totaling 
US$X. The project would consist of three main components as follows: 
 
Project Component 1: Develop the Capacity to Manage, Monitor, Evaluate and Improve PRS 
Implementation.
 
The objective of this component would be to strengthen the Government’s capacity to 
monitor, evaluate, and open the process of consultation for the PRSP and subsequent progress reports. The 
following sub-components will be supported by this operation: 
 
• 
Sub-Component 1.1
: 
Strengthen the Government’s Capacity to Monitor and 
Evaluate PRSP Advances. 
This sub-component would be implemented through 
UNAT and INE and would be geared to implement an integrated monitoring system 
in UNAT and to improve the capacity of three strategic institutions (Health, 
Education, and the National Registry of People) to track changes in key social 
indicators to improve the Government’s capacity to monitor PRSP advances. 
Activities under this subcomponent would include: (i) the design and implementation 
of an integrated monitoring system and the development of monitoring indicators (to 
be financed by the IDB’s parallel project); and (ii) the strengthening of INE to 
support improvements in the national registry of people as well as the administrative 
registries of the education and health sectors. 
 
• 
Sub-Component 1.2
: 
Develop UNAT’s Analytical Capacity.  
This sub-component 
would seek to strengthen UNAT’s capacity to analyze and disseminate the results of 
public programs associated with the Government’s poverty reduction strategy. 
Activities under this subcomponent would include: (i) the recruitment of specialized 
staff for UNAT; (ii) the definition of UNAT’s strategic vision, mission and 
organizational structure; (iii) the carrying-out of impact analyses and assessments of 
PRS- related programs and the dissemination of such studies; and (iv) the design and 
implementation of sector wide programs (SWAPs) in selected sectors via the 
diagnosis and mapping of existing projects, the alignment and integration of projects 
and activities, and the design of adequate standardized administrative procedures and 
fiduciary framework. 
 
• 
Sub-Component 1.3: Enhance the PRS Consultative Process.  
This sub-component 
would systematize the PRSP participatory process through regular consultations with 
communities to identify priorities, complemented by stakeholder involvement in 
designing and implementing the Strategy’s programs. Activities under this 
subcomponent would include: (i) the implementation of an information campaign to 
disseminate the PRS’ goals and targets; (ii) strengthening of work undertaken by the 
PRSP Consultative Council (CCERP) in PSR monitoring and evaluation; (iii) the 
development of systems to encourage local participation in PRS programs and 
projects monitoring; and (iv) analysis and evaluation of prospects for expanding 
decentralized services of a number of sectors to multifunctional community 
associations.

Improvements in Public Service Management and Delivery. 
The objective of this component would be 
to support the implementation of the Civil Service Act, thereby ensuring a more equitable working 
environment with better performance incentives and improved civil service quality. It would furthermore 
seek to enhance competitiveness and the investment climate by improving the efficiency and quality of 
basic public services. 
 
• 
Sub-Component 2.1: Implement the New Civil Service Law.
  This sub-component 
would help the Government implement the Civil Service Law currently under 
discussion at the ministerial level. Activities under this subcomponent would include: 
(i) the implementation of the Human Resource Management system (SIARH) by 
gathering data from all public sector agencies and by training personnel to fully 
operate the system; (ii) support to the implementation of the new institutional 
arrangements governing civil service reform; (iii) the carrying out of studies and the 
provision of advisory services to design and implement a new remuneration scheme 
for the public sector ensuring its fiscal sustainability; (iv) training public sector 
personnel in topics related to human resource management; (v) support Government 
efforts to reengineer the public administration in three additional Public Secretariats 
(possible candidates could include SERNA, SOPTRAVI, and XXX); (vi) the 
contracting of specialized firms to carry out independent personnel evaluation 
activities in pilot agencies; and (vii) the carrying out of dissemination programs and 
information campaigns to build consensus around the reform. 
 
 
• 
Sub-Component 2.2
: 
Improve the Management and Provision of Public Services.
 
This sub-component would seek to promote private sector participation in the 
provision of public infrastructure services and to encourage decentralization in the 
management of social services. Activities under this subcomponent would support: (i) 
legal and technical work underlying the modernization of HONDUTEL, the 
consolidation of the government’s policy-making capacity, and strengthening of the 
regulatory agency CONATEL; (ii) legal and technical work geared to reform the 
energy sector and to facilitate the restructuring and modernization of ENEE; (iii) the 
implementation and strengthening of institutional arrangements governing the ports 
sub-sector and support to efforts aimed at attracting private investment for ports 
concessions; (iv) strengthening of the Planning agency (CONASA) and the 
Regulatory agency (ERSAPS) in the water and sanitation sector; (v) studies aimed at 
improving the quality and accuracy of environmental data and risk assessments as 
well as reviewing the policies and regulatory framework underlying the 
environmental sector; and (vi) CPME’s coordination and technical advisory activities.

The objective 
of this
 component would be to strengthen the Government’s budgetary, financial, and 
fiduciary management to produce a more accurate, timely, relevant, and transparent 
public sector  
 
• 
Sub-Component 3.1: Making SIAFI Operational
. This sub-component would help 
develop a set of norms, methodologies, and computer-based systems that would allow 
the Government to prepare an effective and transparent budget compatible with the 
PRS.  Activities under this subcom
p
onent would include:

sector entities1. 
 
• 
Sub-Component 3.2: Strengthening the Institutional Capacity to Ensure 
Accountability through Internal and External Control.

transparency in public financial management. Activities under this subcomponent 
would include: (i) the enhancement of TSC’s institutional capacities through the 
provision of necessary equipment; (ii) training of personnel of internal control units 
of all public sector entities in various skills related to new regulations and control 
abilities; and (iii) the provision of
