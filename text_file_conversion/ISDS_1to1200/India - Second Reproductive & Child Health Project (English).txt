B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
The development objective of this proposed operation would be to increase the utilization of essential 
reproductive and child health services of good quality, publicly or privately provided, especially in states,  
districts and urban areas with low human development indicators.  
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
The project would support the Second Phase of the national Reproductive and Child Health Program and 
it is expected to have the following three components: 
 
\01\02
(i) Component 1-- Enhancement of the RCH Program in the States
.  This component would 
support the RCH Program in the states.  In order to receive funding from the project, initially 
each of the states would need to formulate a five-year program acceptable to GOI and the Bank 
that would: (i) clearly specify measurable goals and outputs in terms of maternal and child health-
related indicators, such as immunization coverage and percentage of births attended by qualified 
attendants; (ii) give priority to districts and urban areas with below (state) average human 
development indicators; (iii) incorporate a revised strategy to improve maternal and child health 
which places a greater focus on quality, gender, reproductive rights, and the neonatal period; (iv) 
incorporate a new sub-program for adolescents; (v) include meaningful efforts to engage the 
private sector; (vi) experiment with demand-side interventions (such as community based health 
insurance or vouchers for poor women to pay for delivery in accredited facilities, public or 
private); (vii) include monitoring and evaluation activities which would allow tracking 
performance in terms of goals/outputs and not merely inputs; and (viii) contain initiatives to 
improve coordination with related programs.  Continuing funding from the project would be 
dependent on satisfactory performance, principally as measured by progress towards an agreed 
set of benchmarks, to be assessed on an annual basis in joint discussions between the GOI, 
individual state governments, and the Bank (performance-based financing).  The five-year plans 
would also need to incorporate significant initiatives to improve the capacity of the State 
Page  2
 
 
Departments of Health and Family Welfare to oversee the whole reproductive and child health 
sector, both public and private.  This would include activities to enhance the Departments’ 
capacity to plan, supervise, monitor and provide technical assistance in program implementation. 
 
An important aspect of the formulation of state plans would be the use of a coherent approach to 
determine the incremental inputs to be allocated to the program in each state.  This would result from 
a state-led exercise to determine the most cost-effective ways of removing bottlenecks to the 
increased use of essential good quality reproductive and child health services (Marginal Budgeting for 
Bottlenecks approach).  
 
\01\02
(ii) Component 2 --Improvement of Program Management
. This component would include 
activities to strengthen the program’s central procurement and financial management and the 
MOHFW’s capacity for technical oversight of the states’ programs.  
 
\01\02
(iii) Component 3 --Polio Eradication.
  This component would provide continued Bank support 
beyond the end of 2005 to eradicate polio through providing funds for polio vaccine.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project covers all the 35 states and Union territories of India. The Bank support will especially focus 
on the districts and urban areas with low human development indicators related to reproductive health. 
Targeting of such districts and urban areas will be undertaken during project preparation. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The MOHFW would carry out a partial environmental assessment.  A Tribal Development Plan for RCH 
would be developed building on the Social Assessment already carried out by the MOHFW.
