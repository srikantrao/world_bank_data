A.2. Project Objectives 
The project development objectives will support the National Poverty Reduction Strategy 
goals to expand access to educational services by addressing supply, demand, quality and 
efficiency constraints, especially focusing on the poorest and groups at risk. 
 
Primary and lower secondary schools increasingly demonstrate characteristics of 
effective schooling and ultimately show improvements in student enrolments, 
student flows and learning achievement, specifically among poor and 
disadvantaged children. 
 
Government policy and administration undertake explicit actions to improve 
institutional capacities to address issues of ed
ucational access, staff development, 
Page  2
availability of learning materials and education quality assurance at all 
educational levels. 
 
The two main project indicators are: 
·
Improved access to education for poor and disadvantaged children as measured by an 
increase in net primary and lower secondary enrollment rates. 
·
Enhanced education quality service delivery as indicated by overall improvements in 
student achievement scores in mathematics and Khmer for students in grades 3, 6 and 
9. 
A.3. Project Description 
CESSP will strive to reach the proposed development objectives through a two-pronged strategy.  First, the 
project will seek to enable equitable access to education through both supply- and demand-side 
interventions.  Second, it will promote decentralized mechanisms to nurture educational quality 
enhancements.  The former strategy will involve: (a) school construction in areas with incomplete primary 
or no lower secondary schools as well as (b) reduction of access barriers through targeted scholarships to 
encourage disadvantaged children to attend school.  The latter will entail: (a) the strengthening of 
decentralized quality education service delivery and (b) the development of a national assessment 
monitoring system.  Measures will be undertaken to ensure maximum coordination between the supply and 
demand-side interventions.  Ten percent of project funds will be reserved to finance emerging needs and 
activities in the ESSP and within the boundaries of the stated project development objectives, to be agreed 
with IDA during the course of implementation. 
 
The theory of change underpinning the program is the following.  First, both supply- and demand-side 
barriers to schooling access need to be lifted.  Children must have schools available in their vicinity, and 
their participation must be supported through schemes that can bring them closer to schools and reduce the 
direct or opportunity costs of attendance.  Coming to school, however, is no guarantee that learning will 
occur.  The relevance and quality of schooling must be promoted by fostering a reflective process within 
schools to identify their challenges and develop improvement action plans.  This process can be catalyzed 
through an institutional participatory framework that includes community members, parents, school staff, 
district supervisors and provincial officers.  School improvement planning will be complemented with 
professional development efforts to enhance principal and teacher technical capacity to deliver the 
academic program more effectively.  An independent national assessment system will monitor progress and 
provide specific feedback to educators and policymakers to guide the education system towards improved 
student participation and academic achievement outcomes, the ultimate objective of the project.
 
Project implementation will strive to reach the most disadvantaged children (targeting 
girls, ethnic minority areas and communes with high poverty incidence preferentially).  
Over the long term, the project will benefit primary and lower secondary school children 
nationwide by strengthening the institutional and technical capacity for education quality 
improvement planning and administration.  Sustainable and quality enhancing 
management, supervisory and pedagogical practices will be promoted so as to foster 
greater efficiency and effectiveness in educational service delivery. 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The project will be implemented nationwide, but targeting communes with high poverty 
incidence, including areas where ethnic minorities reside.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Contractor specifications to address environmental issues, including construction dust 
and noise control, waste management, site management, provision of clean water and 
sanitation facilities, unexploded ordinance removal, asbestos-containing material 
demolition management and preservation of cultural and historic resources have also 
been adequately addressed and integrated to bidding documents. 
 
No land acquisition plans or resettlement framework are required, since civil works will 
largely take place within existing school campuses or, in a small number of cases, on 
vacant and idle land owned by the Government that is free from all encumbrances, 
habitation, dispute, claim or controversy. The use of the land will neither require a 
resettlement plan nor a resettlement framework. 
 
A
national “scholarship program” in Component 1.2, designed to reduce barriers for 
disadvantaged children, is the primary instrument directly addressing the issue of 
Indigenous Peoples’ inclusion.  Scholarships are recognized as a means to lower the 
direct and opportunity costs to education.  The expansion of targeted incentive schemes 
for the poorest and groups at risk is an actionable measure under the NPRS and the 
General Policy for Highland Peoples Development 
(produced by the Inter-Ministerial 
Committee for Highland Peoples Development). 
 
Some project activities will be focused on poor areas where ethnic minorities reside.  
CESSP is expected to enhance the livelihoods of indigenous peoples in the following 
ways.  First, the proposed school facilities expansion plan will play a positive influence in 
enabling ethnic minority children to complete primary and continue on to secondary 
schooling by reducing the distance away from school.  Second, scholarship support will 
be provided to reduce the direct and opportunity costs to education.  Third, the project 
will foster professional capacity building and development of indigenous peoples as 
teachers.  
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Not applicable 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not applicable 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
As mentioned above, specific environmental protection clauses will be included in all 
civil works contracts.  The project will promote g
ood governance by encouraging 
Page  5
community voice and parental participation, accountability for results, transparency in the 
management of resources and stakeholder feedback mechanisms.   
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Project preparation was informed by over 400 informants
—including community 
members, teachers and primary and lower secondary students—from urban, rural and 
remote areas.  Focus group discussions were held in three provinces.  Civil society 
participation was also incorporated during the project design stage through the 
representation of the NGO Education Partnership in the project Steering Committee. 
 
The project will promote local participation and involvement through a variety of 
avenues, such as community-contracting schemes for school facilities development, 
participation in local management committees for the scholarship program, involvement 
in school planning and encouragement of local accountability through public 
dissemination of information on school performance and resource allocation.
