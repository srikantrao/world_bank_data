                           1- develop, implement the national health financing strategy: integrate all different strategies implemented such as
                           targeted free health care, PBF and health insurance;
                           2- strengthen the financial and operational management of the National Health Insurance Scheme by improving: (i)
                           implementation capacity of the National Health Insurance Center to identify and include poor's in health insurance
                           mechanism;
                           3- develop a health equity and Financial Protection datasheets which will provide a picture of equity and financial
                           protection in the health sectors.

                           C. Project Description
                           The project comprises of three components. The first component, supporting health-financing reforms towards
                           universal health coverage (UHC) by combining:

                           (i) Health insurance scheme, mainly community based health insurance aiming at decreasing resilience and

                           vulnerability;

                           (ii) a Free health care targeting utilization, and quality of PHC services at the county level with a focus on RMNCAH;
                           and

                           (iii) Performance based financing: Burkina piloted a three years PBF with an embedded impact evaluation in 15 districts
                           of six regions.

                           Activities includes:

                                 1. Analyze of political economy and how “stewardship” function is exercised in Burkina Faso, especially what are
                                    the policy instruments used and how health policy dialogues are structured and achieved, with a focus on how
                                    RMNCAH issues are taken into account or dealt with. We would scrutinize not only interactions within Ministry
                                    of Health both inside and between central and decentralized levels, but also that with Ministry of Finance and
                                    non-State stakeholders (civil society organizations – CSO –, private health sector, traditional and religious
                                    leaders, NGOs and donor agencies). This work will be done by analyzing processes surrounding the
                                    strategic/operational planning (including monitoring and evaluation) of relevant policies or strategies, such as
                                    the National Nutrition Policy, the National Health Financing Strategy or the Strategic Plan for the Survival of
                                    Children under five.
                                 2. Undertake a health financing situational analysis using the guideline provided by WHO[1]. This would include:
                                    (i) key contextual factors that influence health financing policy and attainment of policy goals; (ii) an overview
                                    of health expenditure patterns; (iii) a review of health financing arrangements; and (iv) priorities for health
                                    financing reform.
                                 3. Investigate the missed opportunities within the framework of public-private partnership for health and identify
                                    barriers and challenges of such partnerships. Indeed, the private sector is a major healthcare provider,
                                    especially in urban areas, with sometimes more available and/or better technical platforms. Interactions
                                    between public and private sectors are actually weak and rather informal while a closer collaboration would
                                    help for instance improve completeness of health statistics and even medical treatment of some cases. This
                                    activity would engage both the public and private sectors in improving the regulatory framework in order to
                                    improve full collaboration between the public and private sectors, by defining partnership policies, criteria for
                                    cooperation and policy instruments to better align private-for-profit providers with the government goals.
                                 4. Health financing situation analysis would help countries to develop sustainable health financing systems that

                                    would result in increasing domestic resources for health, including private sector and innovative financing,
                                    improving efficiency and reducing inequities.
                                 5. Implementation research that will be conducted would help to increase efficiency gains of interventions that
                                    theoretically already represent value for money. Indeed, it is important to ensure that high-impact and
                                    evidence-based interventions are prioritized and implemented in an effective and results-oriented manner.

                           - Conduct small scale studies, including implementation research, to learn more about how to deliver high impact
                           interventions more effectively. Subjects to be studied could include: (i) why so few children are treated with ORS while
                           suffering from diarrhea; (ii) why all the recommended care for the newborn are not provided; (iii) why community IMCI
                           is struggling to be actually implemented; or (iv) why few women do their first prenatal visit in the first trimester and
                           also why few make all the four recommended visits, including the provision of focused antenatal care visits. Such
                           investigations will disaggregate data by wealth quintiles, urban/rural divide, etc.
