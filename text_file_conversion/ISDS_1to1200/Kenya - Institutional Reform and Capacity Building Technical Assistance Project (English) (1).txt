B.  Project Objectives  
 
The proposed Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP) will support the 
Government of Kenya뭩 Investment Program for the Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth 
and Employment Creation (IP-ERS) 2003-2007, which lays out the government뭩 plan to 
reinvigorate and sustain economic growth and poverty reduction.  This plan, which was prepared 
with the full participation of Parliament, non-governmental organizations, development partners 
and other stakeholders, rests on three pillars: (a) economic growth, (b) equity and poverty 
reduction, and (c) governance.  The governance pillar seeks to fight corruption, establish a lean, 
efficient, and accountable public service that concentrates financial and human resources on the 
delivery of core government services to businesses and citizens. The proposed project will 
support the governance pillar of the ERS (government뭩 poverty reduction strategy). 
 
C.  Project Description  
 
Project components are based on the priority public sector reform components identified in the 
Economic Recovery Strategy as well as the updated Public Sector Reform Strategy. This will be 
a
Technical Assistance Investment Loan for 4 years, linked closely to an Adjustment Loan.

Component 1. Budget and Public Financial Management
 
(US$15 m): The objective of this 
component is to make budget processes and public financial management (PFM) more 
transparent, accountable and responsive to policy priorities. It will therefore aim at strengthening 
financial resource planning, budget preparation and implementation, strengthening financial 
controls and reduction of fiduciary risks, making procurement transparent and efficient and 
expenditure monitoring and audit.  It is also aimed at an efficient generation and management of 
revenue.  It will have the following sub-components: 
 

Subcomponent 1.1 Strengthening Medium Term Expenditure Framework and budget 
processes; 

Subcomponent 1.2 Strengthening public financial management; 

Subcomponent 1.3 Implementation of IFMIS, IPPD and the development of an IT 
Strategy; 

Subcomponent 1.4 Strengthening the External Audit System; 

Subcomponent 1.5 Strengthening the Internal Audit System; 

Subcomponent 1.6 Strengthening the National Procurement System; 

Subcomponent 1.7 Support to key Parliamentary Committees for effective political 
oversight of public financial management; and 

Subcomponent 1.8 Strengthening Revenue Collection and Management for the Kenya 
Revenue Authority  
 
Component 2. Capacity Building Fund
 (US$7.0m):  
The objective of this component is to provide capacity building support to the five key ministries 
(Finance, Agriculture, Planning and Development, Trade and Industries and Local Government) 
that are critical to the achievement of prior actions identified in the ERSSC policy matrix as well 
as achieving benchmarks for future budget support operations.  This fund will be demand-driven, 
i. e. the inputs are to be specified by the targeted ministries who would demonstrate how they 
intend to use the funds to achieve the benchmarks.  
 
Component 3. Project Management and Coordination
 (US$3.0m):  
The objective of this component is to provide an effective and efficient coordinating body and 
process that ensures that IRCBP implementation complies with the World Bank Financial 
Management Guidelines.  This component will also hire consultants for the duration of the 
project that addresses cross-cutting themes such as Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), and a 
communication strategy and an action plan which are necessary for both components one and 
two.

A
Cabinet sub committee to be chaired by the Minister of Public Service has already been 
formed to provide strategic policy guidance to the reform process. A technical committee 
comprising Permanent Secretaries from eight ministries will meet regularly to address major 
problems affecting project implementation. A Permanent Secretary in charge of public sector 
reform has already been appointed and reports to the Head of Public Service.  We anticipate that 
she will serve as the Government's executing agency, with project oversight and 
monitoring/evaluation responsibilities. The day to day management of the project will be 
delegated to a Project Coordinating Unit probably moved under the Permanent Secretary in 
charge of public service reform. This Unit will oversee the overall project implementation
