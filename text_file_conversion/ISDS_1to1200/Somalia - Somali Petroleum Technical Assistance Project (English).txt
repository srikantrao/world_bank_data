  Support(EGPS)
  B. Project Development Objective(s)
  To strengthen the institutional framework and the capacity of the Somali petroleum sector to manage the sector and
  wealth for sustainable development impacts.

  C. Project Description
  Component 1: Facilitate inclusive agreement

  Building on political accommodation and knowledge building work over the past two years, FGS now
  considers to establish a Forum to develop the agreement on ownership, management and revenue sharing of
  petroleum resources, which needs support to facilitate this sensitive process (outputs: logistics support,
  secretariat, experts on call).

  Component 2: Strengthen capacity in the sector

  Institutional development of the Somalia Petroleum Authority (SPA). Based on previous work to develop the
  legal and regulatory framework for the SPA, support is now required to train the staff of the SPA and enable
  them to run the SPA, govern and regulate agreements, and develop the petroleum policy and strategy
  (output: reports).

  Component 3: Project Management

  This component will finance costs associated with overall project implementation. An annual work plan will
  be agreed between the Implementing Agency and the Bank to establish the parameters of the costs and
  activities to be financed under this component.




  SAFEGUARDS


 D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
    analysis (if known)
 The project will not support any construction activities on the ground and will focus on capacity building
 activities, including policy dialogues, training and report preparation. As a consequence, none of the
 envisaged activities under the project are expected to have a footprint with adverse environmental or social
 impact that could be categorized as sensitive, diverse or precedent setting. The project will not provide
 support to land use planning or spatial planning. The activities under the project will be related only to the
 onshore areas of Somalia as well as to those areas offshore the coast of Somalia that are not disputed. The

 proposed Project Area will therefore be defined to exclude any disputed areas, whether onshore or offshore.
 As a consequence, none of the envisaged activities are expected to have any impact on any areas that may
 be the subject of a dispute between Somalia and any of the neighboring countries.

 E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
 Petroleum is a new sector in Somalia with small exploration projects starting up. The development of
 consultative structures and arrangements for dialogue will need to take this uncertainty into account.
 Somalia has some environmental regulation, policies and standards, but few of them are petroleum sector
 specific. The FGS may have to develop petroleum-specific policies and regulations on involuntary
 resettlements.
