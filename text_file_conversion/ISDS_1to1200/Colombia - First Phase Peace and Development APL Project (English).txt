A.2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to reduce the vulnerability of the poor population in five 
conflict-affected regions of Colombia.  The project assumes that building assets is a measure that 
contributes to mitigate the risk of displacement, and that restoring a basic safety net to displaced 
families is a first step in their social and economic stabilization.  However, the project does not 
address directly the problem of conflict and violence but supports people to reduce and mitigate 
the risk of conflict and violence. 
  
A.3. Project Description 
The primary beneficiaries of the Project will be poor and vulnerable families living in the regions, currently 
displaced families, community organizations, associations of small producers, or micro-enterprises and 
municipal governments. Components A and B have been defined on the basis of the populations served, 
e.g. poor and vulnerable residents of the  regions (Component A) and displaced families that return to their 
place of origin or relocate to the target regions (Component B). The activities of component A and B are 
similar, but the allocation of resources follow rules that are specific to each populations as will be 
explained later. The project components are: 
 
Component A, Building of Social, Economic and Environmental Assets. Us$ 10,995.000 
 
The objective of the component is to equip poor and vulnerable populations in rural and urban communities 
with means to mitigate the negative impact of possible exposures to conflict.  The method utilized under 
this component would be the grant financing of small-scale community subprojects that would facilitate the 
building of social economic and environmental assets at the local level.  The activities and targets of the 
component are the following:  
 
(i) Food security to about 80,000 families. This intervention seeks to promote the production of basic staple 
food crops for self-consumption and to reduce the costs of purchased foods.  Preferably, the supported food 
crops will be part of an economic activity in the area.  Subprojects will fund technical advice, inputs, small 
equipment, and capacity building to promote or consolidate organizations and knowledge. 
(ii) Generation of income or employment through farm and non-farm productive and small business 
activities for about 20,000 families. The component will support organizations of small producers to 
embark on new productive activities or improve the productivity of existing ones through funding of 
technical studies, technical assistance, and purchases of inputs and equipment.  Funding will also support 
capacity building to improve business skills, consolidate organizations, and establish partnerships and 
linkages with agro-industrial firms or financial institutions. The majority of the investment funding for

beneficiaries access the co-financing mechanisms of FINAGRO and BANCOLDEX, which have allocated 
about US$40 million to support farm and non-farm productive projects for vulnerable populations in high 
conflict regions of the country.   Beneficiary contributions for each subproject will be no less than 10 
percent, and transfer to individual subprojects will not exceed US$100,000.  
 
(iii) Promotion of access to social networks and the enhancement of a culture of development and peace in 
the region to about 100,000 citizens. The component will give priority to increasing educational and 
employment opportunities for youth, disseminating information and awareness about rights to education 
and health services, improving the quality of these services, and enhancing networks for regional 
development, a sense of belonging, and peaceful coexistence.  It will also support basic sanitation and 
home improvements of about 2,000 households, following the guidelines established by RSS.  
 
(iv) Promotion of activities with a positive impact on the environment. The emphasis will be on education, 
awareness, and actions geared to protect or enhance environmental assets such as watershed protection; 
conservation of the natural landscape; and sustainable use of natural resources such as water, soil, and 
biodiversity.   
 
Component B, Return or Relocation of Displaced Families. Us$11,350.000 
 
The objective of the component is to provide a basic safety net to 20,000 currently displaced families who 
are willing and able to return to their place of origin or to relocate. The activities and targets of the 
component are: (i) providing food security to about 20,000 families (52.6 percent of the total displaced 
population in the target regions) to produce basic staples for self-consumption as in component 1; (ii) 
promoting access to health and education services of the municipality and the quality of these services to 
which the displaced population is entitled by law; (iii) developing social and economic opportunities for 
17,000 families as they begin to stabilize. The types of subprojects are similar to those of component 1; (iv) 
providing basic sanitation elements to 6,000 families to ensure minimum living conditions, including minor 
home improvement, water supply, and sanitary equipment. Eligibility and the amount of the support 
provided for basic sanitation will follow the guidelines established by RSS.  
 
The selection of these beneficiaries and the allocation of resources for families arriving at the 
municipalities targeted by the Project will follow the protocol of the RSS for return and relocation. This 
protocol, 
Manual de Procedimientos para el Apoyo a los Procesos de Retorno de Población Desplazada 
Victima del Conflicto Armado
, the official norm established in the government program, specifies 
eligibility criteria, procedures, and amount for each type of support. Target numbers and the budget for the 
component were based on these support costs.. The manual is one of the documents of the Project file. 
    
 
 
Component C, Strengthening institutions and governance at the local level. US$ 5.950.000 
 
The objective of this component is to develop the capacity of regional leadership of RSS, the PDPs, local 
governments, and the territorial committees of the SNAIPVD (
Sistema Nacional de Atención Integral a la 
Población Vulnerable y Desplazada
) to implement the Project and promote responsive public institutions.  
Strengthening leadership and public institutions is geared to enhance their capacity to promote community-
led social, environmental, and economic activities to benefit poor and vulnerable families living in the area 
of influence, as well as to assist the return or relocation of displaced families.  
 
The component will support the incremental staffing, goods, services, learning, and technical assistance 
needs of the national RSS and its territorial units, and PDPs to implement the project. Special attention will 
be given to the required training of the staff of the Project Management Unit and PDPs in Bank norms and 
procedures, particularly procurement, financial, and safeguard matters. The project will also support 
training, technical assistance, diffusion of information, and special studies needed to enhance the capacity 
of the members of SNAIPVD’s Territorial Committees to adequately fulfill responsibilities regarding 
preparation of Integrated Master Plans and the provision of services to the displaced populations. The 
Project’s budget shows the distribution of the resources of the component among the five target regions.  
 
Component D, Project Management Unit and M&E 
Page  4
 
 
 
The objective of the component is to support the establishment of the PMU and the monitoring and 
evaluation system. The overall functions of the PMU are described in Annex 6. 
 
The component will support at the national level, a general coordinator, three specialists that combine 
sector and regional skills, including an environmental and an a monitoring and evaluation specialist, a 
lawyer, an administrator, an administrative and financial assistant, and a technical assistant.  Each one of 
the five regions will have a small unit comprised of a management specialist and a M&E assistant.    
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The project will be implemented in five regions of Colombia (Magdalena Medio, Oriente Antioqueno, 
Macizo Colombiano, Norte de Santander, and Montes de Maria).

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The key safeguard policy issues raised by the project relate to ensuring the environmental appropriateness 
and oversight of productive subprojects included in Component One, and ensuring that project benefits are 
extended to indigenous populations who live within three of the project areas of intervention. These issues 
are being addressed through an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an Indigenous Development Plan 
(IPDP) currently under preparation. 
 
Project environmental procedures have been designed to identify and mitigate potential environmental 
impacts of proposed interventions, and incorporating environmental awareness into Project-sponsored 
development plans (Annual Operating Plans) for each region. The environmental project goals are to: 1) 
develop ex-ante procedures adequate to deal with any potential subproject in each area; 2) ensure project 
design includes monitoring of direct, indirect and cumulative impacts; 3) assure that sufficient capacity 
exists at the regional and central levels to implement the procedures; 4) promote technical assistance to 
mainstream environmental considerations into the design and implementation of subprojects; and 5) 
encourage specific activities to protect and enhance environmental assets.   
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
                                                          
 
*
 
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  5
 
 
The project design addresses any potential indirect and/or cumulative impacts through the inclusion of 
mitigation measures specific to each kind of expected intervention (subproject), flagging of subprojects 
with greater potential risk for intensive monitoring, and a strong overall monitoring program intended to 
identify any impacts not predicted. Monitoring results will be used to fine-tune mitigation measures, 
screening criteria and procedures. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not applicable. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
An Environmental Framework and Indigenous Peoples Framework have been developed by the borrower. 
Additional work to support these frameworks will be implemented prior to project implementation.  
 
The Environmental Framework details the types of subprojects expected along with their potential impacts, 
with procedures (including screening criteria, licensing requirements, mitigation measures and ongoing 
monitoring) to offset those impacts. The environmental framework will be incorporated into the Operation 
Manual for each region. This framework will satisfy Bank requirements for Environmental Assessment 
(OP 4.01), Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), and Pest Management (OP 4.09). In addition, an assessment of 
existing capacity for environmental management, with recommendations to improve that capacity, where 
necessary, will be developed prior to project implementation. 
 
The project has developed an Indigenous Peoples Framework (IPDF) as the project areas include 
indigenous territories (
resguardos) 
and indigenous beneficiaries within three of the five areas (Cauca, 
Norte Santender, and Montes de Maria). The IPDF outlines the steps to be taken to ensure that the Project 
benefits indigenous peoples in the target regions in culturally compatible manners. The IPDF recommends 
that Project-sponsored activities take into account the 
Planes de Vida
 developed for each indigenous 
territory, and consider supporting the implementation of some portion of these plans consistent with project 
objectives. Additional studies will be developed prior to project implementation to set forth specific 
recommendations regarding the form and level at which project interventions can be directed in each 
region. Activities included within the IPDF will be implemented under Component One of the Project.  
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders include displaced peoples, community groups, small producers, indigenous groups, civil 
society and the public sector. These groups have been heavily involved in the project design and will 
likewise participate in project execution.  
 
Both the Environmental Framework and IPDF include extensive consultation of project beneficiaries, and 
both documents were disclosed in-country in Spanish on April 12, 2004.
