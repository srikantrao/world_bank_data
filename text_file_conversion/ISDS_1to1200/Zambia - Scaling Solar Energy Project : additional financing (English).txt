2. Project Objectives:

The project development objective is to increase solar electricity generation capacity and
diversify electricity generation resources in Zambia.

3. Project Description:

As part of the World Bank Group (WBG) Scaling Solar program, the Government of the
Republic of Zambia (GRZ) awarded to Enel Green Power (“the Sponsor?) the contract to finance,
construct and operate a 34.0 MWp solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant (“the project?) at the
Lusaka South Multi-Facility Economic Zone (LS-MFEZ) in Zambia. The project is one of the
two winning 50MW solar PV IPP projects in Zambia. The two projects are located on the same
site side-by-side of each other. The first project, Neoen Bangweulu, was disclosed in January
2017.

The Sponsor and IDC (the Industrial Development Corporation, an investment company owned
by GoZ, have set up a special purpose vehicle dedicated to the project (“the Company?, or
“Ngonye Power Company Limited?). Enel Green Power, the main sponsor of the project, is the
renewable energy division of multinational energy company Enel and generates electricity from
renewable sources (solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal or biomass). Enel Green Power
develops and operates renewable power plants in Europe, Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania for
a total managed capacity of around 39 GW. The Zambia PV power plant to be built under the
WBG’s Scaling Solar program will operate on a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)
signed with ZESCO, the integrated electricity utility company of Zambia. The total project cost is
estimated at up to US$45 million (including transaction costs). The World Bank (WB) is
providing a payment guarantee and IFC’s proposed investment consists of an A loan of up to $12
million.

The power plant covering a maximum footprint area of about 50.2 hectares will require about
105,000 tracker modules and 28 inverters. The proposed PV system will be connected to the grid
and the electrical energy will be evacuated through the Lusaka South MFEZ substation, via a
33kV underground cable. The substation is constructed by ZESCO separately. The underground
cable and related infrastructure to connect to the substation will be financed, implemented and
commissioned by the project company, and then handed over to ZESCO.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the assessment of
environmental and social risks and impacts:

The project site is situated within the Lusaka South Multi Facility Economic Zone (LS MFEZ)
about 15 km to the South and East of the Lusaka Central Business District. The site is bordered
by the Lusaka National Park to the South and some agricultural holdings to the East.
