I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The Nicaragua Precious Woods Project will      reforest 600 ha of (legraded former pasture    t achieve carbon
sequestration and to create a sustainable source    of valuable wood for national and intermat onal   markets in
order to reduce the pressure on natural forests.   In addition, the project will include the pre ervation of 350
ha of existing secondary forests and provide   employment in the area. This will enable     sus ainable income-
generation options for poor and vulnerable    comnmunities in southwestern Nicaragua. The        roject will thus
bring along not only carbon sequestration     but also benefits regarding ecological, wildlif     and landscape
diversity.

The estimated total sequestration would equal    297,045 t C02e by 2017 (including 175,647       C02e, or 59%,
by 2012).

As with all BioCF projects, this project    represents a unique opportunity to simultaneou       ly promote the
objectives   of the United Nations Conventions            on Climate Change,        Biological Diversity,    and
Desertification; to improve rural livelihoods: and to contribute to the sustainable developm     nt objectives of
one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
As indicated above the project consists in the  reforestation of degraded pasture land with   T ak and valuable
native wood species on to former cattle ranches    in southwestern Nicaragua. The project co     ponents are:
1.Reforestation of former pastures. In total  it is planned to reforest 600 ha. The expansion    f the project to
up to 4000 ha is likely if the experiences        made with the proposed activity lead       to positive results
specifically regarding the registration as aCDM project. But it would not be subject to      the agreement with
the BioCarbon Fund.
2. Preservation of the existing secondary   forests. These are located mainly along    creeks, teep slopes and
swamps. As forest preservation is not an eligible   sink activity under the CDM no CERs wi 1be       claimed for
this component. They amount to about     350 ha.

The carbon purchase funds from the BioCarbon          Fund would be spread over a period         f 7 years. It is
expected that the Bank's supervision responsibilities    will be very limited, as no Bank fun   s per se flow to
the project, and that this responsibilitywould not exceed 7 years.

L.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of
the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical~atural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project is located on two former cattle ranches (or Fincas) near the village of Sapoa, community of Cardenas, in
Southwestern Nicaragua between Lake Nicaragua and the Pacific Ocean. The Finca La Pimienta is ocated directly at
the border to Costa Rica, the Finca Javalina about 3 km to the north. The two project sites are not onnected and are
not in the proximity of any protected arca, critical natural habitats or otber culturally or socially sensi ive areas.

The project is situated in the community of Cardenas in the southwest of Nicaragua near the border o Costa Rica (see
map). Cardenas has an area of 228 km2 and a population of 6,388 inhabitants, most ofthem live in ural areas.           In the
Poverty Map of Nicaragua the municipality of Cardenas is classified as having a high level of pove ry with a poverty
head count index of 72.2. Due to the lack of employment opportunities most people live on subsi tence agriculture.
Many migrate to other parts of the country or to Costa Rica.

A Bank mission in March 2005 met with project sponsors Precious Woods (PW), the Nicar gua Designated
National Authority (DNA) representative, Minister of Enviroimlent and with the May r of Cardenas.
(They all expressed strong interest in supporting the project and Minister Arturo Harding emphasized the
importance of the project for the country development plan and other environmental and sector strategies.
According to the Mayor past forestry activity performed by PW has increased employme nt opportunities
for the population in the area).


E. SafeguardsClassification (select one). Category isdetermined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy istriggere the provisions of
that policy apply.                                                                        _
