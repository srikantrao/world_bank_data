B.  Project Objectives 
[from section 3 of PCN]
The  primary  objective  of  the  project  is  to  conserve  biodiversity,  while  improving  rural 
livelihoods.  This would be achieved through testing and establishing decentralized participatory 
approaches  acr
oss  a  range  of    globally  and  nationally  important  landscapes  under  different 
management  regimes.  The expected outcomes of the project include: 1) improved conservation 
of  globally  and  nationally  important  biodiversity;  and  2)  increased  incomes  and  liveli
hood 
opportunities  for  local  communities  from  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of  biological 
resources  and  alternative  income  generating  activities.  Secondary  outcomes  are  1)  improved 
coordination  amongst  service  providers  (state  forest  departments,  local 
government  and  line 
agencies such as agriculture, water supply, irrigation, etc., community institutions, NGOs and 
private sector);  2) acquisition of stakeholders of new roles, skills and incentives that support 
conservation and sustainable use of biologi
cal resources; 3) increased capacity of community and 
local  institutions  to  influence  decisions  on  resource  allocation  and  use  and  manage  such 
resources.

C.  Project Description 
[from section 4 of PCN]
The proposed project is focused on conservation of
 globally and nationally important biological 
diversity, and improving livelihoods and income opportunities for communities in high
-
value 
biodiversity landscapes.  The project will apply culturally appropriate and tested participatory 
approaches  to  support
  opportunities  for  improving  livelihoods  of  rural  forest  dependent 
communities.  Investments will be tailored to individual community needs through a site
-
specific 
microplanning process, building on current planning systems used for ecodevelopment and othe
r 
natural resource management projects in watershed, forestry, etc. The proposed project envisages 
to initially focus on five or six sites of globally and nationally important biodiversity in India, 
identified on the basis  of transparent  ecological, socio
-
economic and  conservation feasibility 
criteria and through a consultative process. The proposed sites will likely include  landscape (or 
seascape) units, each about 1,000
-
2,000 km
2 
or more, containing one or more protected areas (or 
critical conservation a
reas) and forming a viable ecological, socio
-
economic and administrative 
unit.  The  project  duration  is  six  years,  which  will  comprise  of  the  initial  phase  of  capacity 
building and planning of around one year, followed by an implementation phase of five yea
rs.  
Project components will be defined during preparation, but are expected to include the following:
Expansion of successful participatory models across landscape units
 to strengthen linkages 
between conservation and local livelihoods through expansion 
of already successful participatory 
models across broader landscape units.  This would be supported by improved capacity and 
institutional  arrangements  for  integration  of  conservation  and  development  agendas,  and 
expansion  and  replication  of  a  participator
y  management  approach  nationwide  through 
competitive small grants; 
Mainstreaming  biodiversity  and  livelihood  concerns
  into  management  of  production 
landscapes through improving land use practices and better integration of biodiversity objectives 
in rural
 development and livelihood programs; 
Improving  skills,  capacity  and  learning
  for  participatory  management  and  monitoring  of 
biological  resources  through  training,  documentation  and  dissemination  of  best  practice,  and 
establishment 
of 
learning 
centers 
an
d 
networks 
and 
improved 
legal 
and 
institutional 
understanding; 
Improved understanding and knowledge
 of links between biodiversity conservation and local 
benefits through economic valuation of ecosystem services and functions and media outreach to 
create 
awareness and support for conservation and guide policy and decision making;   
Strengthened  monitoring  and  learning  support  systems
  to  develop  appropriate  process, 
output  and  outcome  indicators  (covering  ecological,  social  and  institutional  parameters), 
monitoring system (using field data survey, household data, remote sensing, etc.) and baseline 
would  be  developed  during  project  preparation.  There  would  also  be  strong  emphasis  on 
participatory community monitoring.

Detailed 
institutional  arrangements
  wi
ll  be  developed  during  preparation.    The  Central  
Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) will coordinate and supervise the implementation 
of  the  project.    The  relevant  state  forestry  and  allied  departments  (tribal  development,  rural 
development and oth
ers) are expected to focus on their respective areas of core accountability 
and  comparative  advantage.    For  example,  the  forestry  departments  will  focus  on  technical 
assistance in protected area management, capacity building and regulatory functions to ens
ure 
they  play  a  more  effective  supportive  role  as  communities  develop  forest  and  conservation 
management skills. The partner departments and communities will share responsibility broader 
rural development, and monitoring and evaluation with social audits c
arried out periodically by 
an independent evaluator.  The core implementation activities of the project would be undertaken 
by the communities themselves.  A multi
-
sectoral team will support the process of community 
based  planning and implementation, draw
ing on lessons from other Bank
-
supported projects. 
Specific institutional options that would be considered during project preparation include the role 
of the local government institutions, community organizations, NGOs and forestry and other 
departments in
 project implementation. 
D.  Project location (if known)
The project is being coordinated at the national level.  Specific project areas within the country 
are still to be determined during project preparation based on transparent selection criteria, bu
t 
are likely to include  landscape (or seascape) units, each about 1,000
-
2,000 km
2
 or more, 
containing one or more protected areas (or critical conservation areas) and forming a viable 
ecological, socio
-
economic and administrative unit. It is anticipated t
hat all of the selected sites 
will encompass significant populations of rural poor, including tribals that depend on forests and 
natural areas for at least part of their livelihoods and incomes.
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
[from PCN]
Improving institutional capacity at the village level is central to the design of this operation.  
Although local community institutions might exist in some or all of the proposed sites, these 
groups currently would need support to plan, manag
e and sustainably use some non
-
timber forest 
resources, ecosystems services, and other benefits from forests and conservation areas.  To 
support local community conservation initiatives, the respective forestry departments will need 
to adopt new procedures
 and develop new skills in communication and technical extension.  
Similarly, forestry departments will need to build technical knowledge, capacity and 
coordination skills to influence broader development initiatives in a manner that also takes into 
accoun
t conservation considerations in protected areas and surroundings.
