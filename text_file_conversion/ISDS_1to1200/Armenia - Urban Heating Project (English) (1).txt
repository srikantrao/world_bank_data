A.2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to enable the successful adoption of clean, efficient, safe, and 
affordable heating technologies in urban multi-apartment buildings and schools
.
The project will achieve this objective by (i) removing barriers and creating market 
conditions for the commercial provision of heating services; (ii) providing long-term 
funding from a revolving fund available to service providers and receivers for their 
investments in heat supply systems and energy efficiency measures; and (iii) promoting 
decentralized, efficient boilers, heaters, and equipment to meter and control fuel and heat 
consumption. Natural gas will in most cases be the fuel of choice; (iv) stimulating 
creation and effective functioning of self-regulating community organizations. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
The project will support implementation of the UHS and improve heating in schools 
through the following five components: 
 
Page  2
Component A: Community and private sector mobilization and development of an 
enabling environment for effective and safe provision of heating services (US$ 3.0 
million, of which IDA funding US$ 1 million).
 Technical assistance will be provided in 
two areas: 
 
A1. (US$ 1.0 million, of which IDA funding US$ 0.5 million) 
Development of enabling environment for 
effective and safe provision of heating services including: 
ƒ
Development of regulations, safety norms and standards, and certification of 
suppliers and equipment, including for natural gas supply; 
ƒ
Improvement of legal and regulatory framework to make HOAs more functional 
and to foster market-based provision of heating services.  
 
A2. (US$ 2.0 million, of which IDA funding US$ 0.5 million) 
Community and private 
sector mobilization through:
 
ƒ
Capacity building of heat service providers and local financial institutions; 
ƒ
Implementation of broad information campaigns and public education programs 
to inform the public about the available new heating technologies and their benefits, 
safety norms and standards, the need and benefits of using environmentally clean and 
safe heating solutions and the new approaches to community-led provision of 
communal services; 
ƒ
Establishment of special advisory center(s) to provide private sector and 
communities with support on legal, technical, and financial issues of modern energy 
supply. 
 
Most of the technical assistance (TA) above will be supplied by UNDP/GEF and USAID 
in close collaboration with this project. If these donors commit to provide more than the 
above mentioned funding of US$3 million, the freed-up IDA funds will be reallocated to 
investment component B.  
 
Component B:   Financing of heating and related building infrastructure (US$ 9.3 million, of which 
IDA funding US$ 7.2 million). 
Investment financing for heating of residential buildings will be supported 
under two subcomponents: 
 
B.1 Lending to project beneficiaries (US$ 6.0 million, of which IDA funding US$ 4.2 million).
 
Heat 
providers, HOAs, and individual home owners will be able to access funding for heating infrastructure 
investments. It is estimated that about 7,000 households in multi-apartment buildings without access to 
operational heating services would benefit from these investments. The funds will be channeled from the 
Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2 Fund)
1
through the participating financial 
institutions (PFI) or directly
2
to beneficiaries. In addition, the Fund will offer risk sharing arrangements to 
PFIs. 
 
B.2 Capital grants to the poor (US$ 3.3 million, of which IDA funding US$ 3.0 million). 
 
To enable the poorest households living in multi-apartment buildings to participate in the project and thus 
gain access to improved heating, this component will fund the investments necessary for the connection of 
1
The Fund will also serve as the financing mechanism for an IDA/GEF financed 
renewable energy project. The Fund infrastructure and support of operating costs will be 
shared between the two projects. 
2
The Fund will have the option of lending directly to the project beneficiaries (HOAs, energy service 
companies and individuals) if there is insufficient interest from the financial institutions.  
Page  3
gas, heat and hot water supply to the apartments of the poor. Eligible households will be identified based on 
the existing PFB Program. Roughly 10,000 poor households are expected to be provided with a basic level 
of service from clean heat sources. 
 
Component C: School heating (US$ 5.5 million, of which IDA funding US$ 5.0 million).   
 
Under this component grant financing will be provided to schools for investments in installation and 
rehabilitation of gas-based local heating systems and basic thermal rehabilitation. The schools targeted are 
located in the coldest and poorest cities and towns of the country. Other criteria for selection will be the 
availability of gas supply in the area and the cost-effectiveness of the investment per student. It is estimated 
that about 100 urban schools will receive funding under this component. 
 
Component D: Support for project implementation (US$ 1.0 million, of which IDA 
funding US$ 0.8 million). 
This includes technical assistance and logistical support to the 
R2E2 Fund for project implementation, monitoring and supervision.  
 
Component E: Project preparation (US$ 1.0 million, of which IDA funding US$1.0 
million). 
This component is identical with the project preparation facility, under which 
various activities have been supported that provide the foundation for a successful project 
implementation: awareness building and mobilization of heat providers and consumers; 
removal of some of the legal and regulatory barriers; and design of the institutions 
involved in project implementation. Most importantly, 11 pilot projects were completed 
during the 2003/04 and 2004/05 heating seasons through HOAs, private sector heat 
service providers, and individuals (see Annex 16
for a description and lessons learned). 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
Projects from all over Armenia are eligible for financing. Most of the projects are 
expected to be in established residential urban areas.

Comments: 
All project components should, during operation provide for substantial 
reductions in the use of fossil fuels in general and/or replacement of polluting fuels with 
cleaner fuels. Adverse environmental impacts from infrastructure, if any, are likely to be 
insignificant and occur mostly during construction/ replacement activities. The project 
will involve a financial intermediary, with the pipeline of subprojects to be identified 
during implementation.

OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment. The proposed investments, as a rule, will be small in 
scale with limited and well known impacts on the environment, which can be mitigated 
or eliminated by adhering to good construction practice. For most of the projects, 
preparation of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) would be required which 
would describe the potential threats and the ways of avoiding and/or mitigating them. 
Also, the EMPs will contain provisions for habitat protection and for dealing with 
archeological chance finds. In some exceptional cases preparation of more detailed site 
specific Environmental Assessments might be needed. The level of detail will be decided 
during the screening of subproject proposals by the R2E2 Fund or Participating Financial 
Institutions (PFIs).

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas

Section II 
–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project is specifically designed to provide access to environmentally sustainable 
heating technologies, encourage the replacement of electricity and wood with natural gas 
and reduce fuel consumption through energy efficiency investments in residential 
buildings and schools. If successfully implemented, the project will create preconditions 
for sustainable reforestation effort. The project is not expected to have any significant or 
irreversible long-term negative environmental impact  
 
However, during construction of new or repairing of old boilers, and while laying down 
the limited portions of new pipelines, and performing other project financed activities, 
some short-term, limited-scale disturbances might occur: increased dust and noise levels, 
exposure of workers to asbestos containing materials, accumulated piles of construction  
waste. These negative impacts can be minimized by proper planning and implementation 
of required mitigatory measures, which will be described in the Environmental 
Management Plan for the entire Project (EMP). An investment-specific EMP (if deemed 
necessary during the screening at PFI) will describe potential threats applicable to a 
particular project, or will be incorporated directly into the bidding documents. 
 
At the moment of preparing this ISDS, the project team did not see the need to trigger 
any of the social Operational Policies. Most of the minor works are expected to take place 
inside apartments of benefiting apartment owners. Should there be a need to build new 
pipelines, they would be laid on public rights of way. In case the new pipeline or a new 
boiler house would be constructed on privately owned land, the project proponent would 
need to agree on a fair deal with the land owner for purchase or leasing the land. The staff 
of the R2E2 Fund and loan officers in  PFIs  will be advised in such cases to approach the 
Bank for further guidance.  
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Not applicable 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not applicable 
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues 
The project will be implemented by the R2E2 Fund and selected PFIs   The R2E2 Fund 
will also be implementing the Renewable Energy Project, currently under preparation. 
 
In order to be eligible for financing, the proposed investments would need to comply with 
Armenian national legislation and with the World Bank safeguard policies. The R2E2 
Fund will be a newly established institution with only limited knowledge of the World 
Bank safeguard policies, although every effort will be made to hire staff kn
owledgeable 
Page  6
on environmental and social issues Qualified specialists from the Heating PIU in charge 
of the project preparation may be transferred to the R2F2. Therefore, Component A of the 
project foresees TA support to train R2E2 staff and loan officers in PFIs in the 
application of environmental and social safeguards. 
 
An Operations Manual, which will be prepared for use by all actors involved in project 
implementation, will contain an environmental chapter laying down all the steps and 
procedures which would allow to determine potential environmental and social impacts 
of the proposed investments, and how to correctly assign environmental screening 
categories. Also, the staff of the R2E2 Fund and loan officers at PFIs will be using for 
guidance the Environmental Management Plan, which has been prepared as a framework 
document for entire project prior to appraisal. 
 
The draft Operations Manual will be reviewed by the Bank, endorsed by Armenian 
Ministry of Nature Protection and eventually approved by Board of Trustees of the R2E2 
Fund.
 
It is anticipated that most of the projects will be small in scale and scope and will have 
only limited short term impacts on the environment, which can be mitigated by good 
planning and adherence to good construction practice. Therefore, it is anticipated that in 
the majority of investments neither Environmental Assessment Reports nor 
Environmental Management Plans  would  be needed. Rather, the requirements for 
meeting environmental conditionalities would be described in the environmental chapter 
of each sub-project proposal and incorporated into bidding documents.  
 
It is very unlikely that any Category A project would be financed under this scheme. However, should such 
a
large project be considered, the client would be obliged to prepare a comprehensive EA study under terms 
of reference and quality acceptable to Bank. Based on the findings of the study further decisions would be 
made. 
 
The R2E2 Fund and PFIs staff will be required to monitor regularly compliance of 
contractors and clients in each project, and in case of noncompliance undertake the 
necessary actions to reverse the situation. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Several social assessments have been undertaken between 1999 and 2001 during the preparation of the 
Urban Heating Strategy on which this project is based as well as during project preparation. The latest 
social assessment was implemented in late 2003 by a local NGO and included in addition to a large 
representative survey of urban apartment dwellers in four cities a number of focus group and community 
meetings to discuss issues and options for heating interventions. A conference, in which a broad range of 
stakeholders from the government and non-government organizations participated, was held to discuss the 
role of home owner associations in solving building level problems such as heating. The results of the 
project social assessment were discussed with stakeholders at a workshop in December 2003.  
 
The project team will continue to consult and share information with stakeholders on a 
regular basis during the process of project preparation. Stakeholders are expected to play 
an
important role in implementation of the project. During the proposed public awareness 
Page  7
campaign and in community meetings, the environmental and social aspects of the 
project in general and various heating investments will be discussed. Since the project is 
designed as a community-
based project, it will be ensured that stakeholders’ views 
regarding project selection, design, implementation and monitoring are taken into 
account.
