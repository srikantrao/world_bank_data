A.2. Project Objectives 
Project objective
. The project objective is to build the productive assets of rural communities in selected mountain 
watersheds, in ways that sustainably increase productivity and curtail degradation of fragile lands and ecosystems.   
GEF Objective
.  The global environmental objective will entail protection of globally significant mountain ecosystems by 
mainstreaming sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation considerations within agricultural and associated rural 
investment decisions.  This integrated management approach will also provide replicable models for comparable areas 
throughout the country.  The GEF objective is mainstreamed into the overall development objective and outcomes. 
Outcome indicators
.
  The key outcome indicators will comprise  
\01\02
High proportion of farm productivity, land management, and rural infrastructure investments are 
successful according to agreed economic, financial, social, and environmental standards, and are 
being sustained. 
\01\02
At least half the households where the project is operating directly participate in some part of the 
rural production component. 
\01\02
Reduction in proportion of project participants who are living below the poverty line. 
\01\02
Land and mountain ecosystem degradation trends halted (GEF)   
Output indicators.
  
Implementation will be assessed mainly on the basis of output indicators including:   
\01\02
Total cumulative investment in agriculture production among project participants (from initial grant, 
local contributions, and reinvestment) significantly exceeds projection of project-financed grants 
and capital infusions (implying high participation, desirable social and environmental impacts, high 
rate of commercial success, high repayment, and high revolving funds use).   
\01\02
Land management investments cover a significant area and benefit very poor at least in 
proportionate
 
to their numbers in a community (GEF) 
\01\02
Number of improved public facilities, disaggregated by type of investment (e.g., village drinking 
water, roads, and electricity)    
\01\02
Number of JDCs mobilized and overseeing rural production investments 
\01\02
Significant proportion of farm production and land management investments apply improved 
technologies, and receive good access to necessary inputs and knowledge.   
\01\02
Number of indigenous crop varieties from project area preserved as live specimens (GEF)

Satisfactory project administration as indicated by Bank supervision ratings and public reputation of integrity 
Borrower’s Objectives.
  
The project is consistent with the PRSP, and responds to the Government request.  Investments will 
directly contribute to accelerated growth. The geographical focus targets the disadvantaged.  The community driven 
approaches, integration with local government, capacity development, and project administration address overall governance 
strengthening.  The project is also consistent with the borrower’s agriculture and environment strategies.  The bottom-up 
approach improves the site-specific allocation and use of resources (land, biological, water, and financial).  The project help
s 
foster the enabling environment and avoids inappropriate and ineffective government interventions.  The land management 
subcomponent will improve land access and tenure security, creating an incentive structure that links rights to 
responsibilities.   
Bank Country Assistance Strategy.
  
The proposed project is a priority in the 2003-2005 Country Assistance Strategy.  It 
meets the Bank’s three strategic engagement principles:  (a) it responds to a “strong client pull” and interest in reform, 
especially from the district and raion government levels, and targets some of the country’s poorest areas, (b) it uses a 
programmatic approach focused on transfer of knowledge and capacity by having communities identify and undertake their 
own development priorities, and (c) it works in partnership with NGOs that have acquired significant experience in working 
in the difficult rural mountain environment.  The project addresses the CAS objective of selective support furthering the 
Government’s PRSP agenda by  
\01\02
generating growth through private sector development, especially in the area of agriculture and related agribusiness 
development
 
\01\02
strengthening the institutions needed for a market economy, including combining usufruct rights with land management 
responsibilities on fragile mountain lands, establishing sustainable member-owned credit entities, and building capacity 
and knowledge to meet technical and marketing requirements for viable income-generating investments, and
 
\01\02
improving community--based support of public infrastructure and services on a large scale, in ways which encourage 
empowerment, inclusion of the vulnerable, and social cohesion. 
 
CAWMP also forms a key element of the Bank’s vision for community-linked development, which involves participatory 
local investment initiatives which partner directly with communities, and support at the Jamoat-level for self-governance and 
citizen accountability.  The project is also consistent with the Bank’s Biodiversity Strategy for ECA, which includes a 
priority on combining improved ecosystem management with local income generating activities. It addresses the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF) Operational Program (OP) 12:  “Integrated Ecosystem Management”, combining the concerns 
of Land Degradation OP 15:  “Sustainable Land Management”, Biodiversity OP 4:  “Mountain Ecosystems”, OP 13 
(Biodiversity:  Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity Important to Agriculture), and OP 9 (International 
Waters:  Integrated Land and Water Multiple Focus Area).   
A.3. Project Description 
Project costs  total about US$17.9 m over six years.  Project activities comprise: 
Component I:  Rural Production Investments.  (US$ 12.0 m) 
A.  Farm Productivity Improvement.
  Individuals, and groups of farming households will invest in productivity enhancing 
activities of their choice, most of which will provide immediate income.  Investments may include inputs for annual crops, 
horticulture, livestock, processing, distribution, leasing, and credit facilities.  
B.  Land Resource Management:
  
This subcomponent
 
enables local people to adopt more sustainable 
use of fragile lands that are currently under the jurisdiction of the Jamoat, and provide land use 
certificates after three years of maintenance, subject to continued good land use.  The combination of 
appropriate income-generating investments with soil conservation will enhance the organic content of 
the soil and create incentives for sustainable land use by better addressing interests of local people. 
Groups of nine
1
 or more households working on contiguous areas will make long-term investments such 
as horticulture, woodlots, or fodder, combined with soil and moisture management structures.  Blended 
financing from GEF will almost quadruple the land area covered beyond the level that will be supported 
by the government on purely national grounds.   
                                                          
 
1
 Nine is prescribed for land activity in a contiguous  area of at least 20 ha to be more technically feasible size for 
soil conservation  treatment, for community effort  (given the average rainfed arable land area available is 2.5  ha 
per house hold).  An  odd number nine is prescribed to help resolve the point of view in group dynamics -when any 
issue that is debated,  odd number would automatically break the dead lock and would be led by majority
.

C.  Rural Infrastructure:  
Investments to rehabilitate rural infrastructure will be made to community 
groups.  Typical investments would compliment the agriculture and land resource management 
subprojects, would be small scale (about $4800 on average), and may include drinking water, small 
irrigation, access track rehabilitation, and small power generation.   
Contribution Requirements and Budget Constraints
.  Beneficiaries have to contribute their own resources in the form of 
labor, material and cash, for at least 20% of the total value of any investment.  Investment proposals will be prioritized 
within formulaic fixed budgets for villages based on population. The share of all one-time start-up grants to any one 
household would not exceed $290.  Farm productivity financing in subsequent years will be provided either through 
reinvestment of retained earnings, or through credit or revolving funds
2
.  Rural infrastructure is restricted to productive 
investments and must include operations and maintenance financing arrangements.  They will only be made if no alternative 
funding is available from other donor programs such as the National Social Investment Fund of Tajikistan (NSIFT).   
Component II.  Institutional Support and Capacity Building. (US$ 4.3 m)  
A) 
Research and Demonstration
: This subcomponent helps scientific institutions and line ministries to provide technical 
services including training to communities.  It will include support for seed and seedling production, livestock breeding and 
animal health and husbandry improvements, and market and enterprise analysis and development.  Participating agencies 
include the Tajikistan Agricultural Research System (for research and extension and including preservation of live plant 
specimens in collaboration with the Consultative Group For International Agricultural Research’s (CGIAR) Central Asia and 
Caucasus (CAC) unit in Tashkent). The Farmer’s Training Center, Ministry of Agriculture and other Ministries and the State 
Committees such as Statistical Service, and Land Committee will also benefit.  Blended GEF financing supports the 
preservation of indigenous crop and other specimens. 
B) 
Community Mobilization and Subproject Preparation
: This subcomponent includes training and facilitation for Jamoat 
Development Committees (JDCs) as well as households and common interest groups with support of local facilitators 
(contracted through international NGOs).  It also includes support for small confidence building mobilization grants for each 
village, plus information and experience sharing.  Blended GEF financing enables the planning and sharing associated with 
the additional land resource management investments.   
Component III.  Project Management: (US$3.6 m) 
This component supports project coordination, procurement, disbursement, financial management, reporting, monitoring, 
and evaluation, at both the national level and for each of the four project watershed areas.  It builds on project administrati
on 
capacity and arrangements that already exist for ongoing Bank financed projects.  The component also supports the 
secretariat services provided to the State Level Steering Committee (SLSC) and the Watershed Development Committees 
(WDCs) .  The component supports: 
\01\02
National Project Management Unit
, 
\01\02
Project Coordination Units for the four watersheds
, and  
\01\02
Evaluation
 
Blended GEF financing enables more detailed evaluation of mountain ecosystem degradation trends, as well as exchange of 
experience both within the country and with other countries, thus further strengthening replication impact.   
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
The project watersheds cover 690,000 ha (of which 86% is former pasture land) in the following four mountain river valleys: 
(i) 
Toirsu valley in the Khatlon region, covering the Dangara raion;  
(ii) 
Vanj valley in Gorno-bodakshan region.  
(iii) 
Surkhob (Karategin) valley in the RRS region, covering the raions of Rasht, Tajikabad, Jirgatal and part of 
Darband; 
(iv) 
Zarafshan valley in the Sugd region, covering the Pendjikent, Aini and Mountain Matcha raions; and 
The watersheds are located in separate parts of the country.  Each watershed encompasses a number of larger administrative 
districts or ‘raions’. The raion comprises a number of Jamoats.  The total rural population of the project watersheds is an 
estimated 550 thousand

Comments: 
The project involves a CDD approach in which investment decisions will be defined through the course of 
implementation with the involvement of the beneficiary communities.  An environmental management framework has been 
prepared describing the procedures by which each subproject will be screened for its environmental impacts and appropriate 
environmental management measures will be incorporated.  Before approving any subproject, the approving authorities will 
verify that the subproject complies with relevant national and local environmental laws and regulations and is consistent with 
Bank policy and procedures.   
 
The project will not involve the acquisition of private lands for rural infrastructure rehabilitation. A social assessment was 
 
conducted to investigate the possibility of restriction of access to grazing grounds arising from the transfer of land-use 
certificates to individual households as an incentive for instituting sustainable land management measures. It was determined 
that there is a low possibility for such an issue arising in the project area due to the following reasons: (a) there is no 
transhumance movement of livestock in the project areas; (b) the existing allocation of pasture lands by the Jamoat is 
sufficient to meet local demand; (c) the CDD approach ensures that all land-use transfers have received prior agreement by 
the community and are reflected in the community action plan (CAP); and (d) additional weight is given to participation in 
the selection criteria of project sites to ensure that the CDD approach is truly inclusive. The project will develop appropriat
e 
indicators to monitor this issue during implementation.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. 
Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.  Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.  
The environmental impact of the proposed project is expected to be largely positive.  The project will 
not involve any major construction requiring resettlement or land acquisition, nor invest in the 
construction of dams, new canals or head works that would allow increased water abstraction from main 
sources.  The rehabilitation of the pasture and degraded fragile lands, and planting of woodlots and 
horticultural crops in the mountains slopes will enhance soil and moisture conservation.  The reduction 
in soil erosion will reduce silt loads in the rivers, resulting in beneficial impacts on the downstream 
areas.  Provision of clean potable water in the problem villages would reduce waterborne disease 
incidences and improve villager’s health. 
However, poor design and implementation could result in potential negative environmental impacts, such as soil erosion due 
to poorly managed farm management systems and degradation of adjacent natural habitats and plant species, improper and 
indiscriminate disposal of animal wastes, environmental damages caused by improper construction activities etc.  The project 
may also involve increased use of pesticides and fertilizers, resulting in increased pollution of surface and groundwater.

None 
D.3.
 Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
None 
D.4.
 Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to 
plan and implement the measures described. 
An Environmental Assessment (EA) has been prepared comprising: Volume I - Environmental Management Framework 
(EMF),  and Volume II - Pest Management Plan (PMP).  The EMF identifies the procedures for subproject environmental 
assessment, the roles and responsibilities for implementation, the environmental management guidelines, the environmental 
monitoring and supervision arrangements, and institutional strengthening steps.  Potential adverse impacts will be addressed 
through guidelines and mitigation measures that protect water supplies, assure population health and safety, and promote 
sustainable land use. Temporary minor impacts from small works will be addressed through enforcement of proper design 
standards.  The Pest Management Plan includes provisions of integrated pest management assessment, development, 
training, and networking as well as replacement of harmful pesticide regimes with environmentally friendly alternatives.   
D.5.
 Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with 
an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders at the watershed level include the villagers, including women and youth, common interest groups (eg. 
livestock owners, fuel-wood gatherers, farmers),
 
Jamoat and raion administrations, local inspectorates of the State 
Committee for Nature Protection, agriculture departments and institutes, NGOs, and staff of the PCUs and PMU.  During 
project preparation, consultations have been carried out with all stakeholders through meetings and roundtables organized in 
each of the four watersheds between August-October, 2003.  The project and its environmental aspects have also been 
presented at a national seminar in Dushanbe on February 11 2004.  Given the CDD approach, the project design assures that 
these consultations will continue at every step in the identification, preparation and implementation of the subprojects.
