Environmental Category: A
A.2. Project Objectives
The project objective is to support China's participation in global efforts to mitigate human-induced
climate change by (i) financing the purchase of up to $500 million of HFC-23 credits (approximately 90
million TCO2e) through an Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) with two of China's
chemical manufacturing companies, the Jiangsu Meilan Chemical Group (JMC) and the Changshu 3F
Zhonghao New Chemical Materials Co., Ltd (3F Zhonghao); and (ii) facilitating the application of
substantial revenues accruing to the Government, as a result of the sale of ERs, to sustainable development
through further domestic carbon reduction initiatives, through a partnership with the Government of China,
described in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The partnership would involve the Bank's technical
assistance for establishment and the initial operation of a Clean Development Facility (CDF).
A.3. Project Description
China approved the Kyoto Protocol in August 2002, and there is now strong interest in participation in the
CDM and the market for ERs. HFC-23 is a potent greenhouse gas (at 11,700 times the global warming
potential of carbon dioxide). China is the world's largest source of HFC-23 emissions. HFC-23 emission
reductions projects in China will therefore contribute significantly to global efforts to mitigate climate
change.
   This project will involve installation of incineration facilities to destroy HFC-23 emissions generated
during production of HCFC-22 at Changshu 3F Zhonghao New Chemical Materials Company, Ltd.
(Changshu 3F) and Jiangsu Meilan Chemical Company (Jiangsu Meilan). The thermal oxidation
technology to be used at these incineration facilities is the only approved methodology for HFC-23
emission reduction, with a destruction efficiency of over 99.99 percent. This technology has been
successfully used for destroying HFC-23 in the UK and Japan, and also in two CDM projects (Republic of
Korea and India). The proposed project will result in a Carbon Finance Emissions Reduction Purchase
Agreement and does not involve any Bank lending. As a trustee of the various Carbon Funds it manages,
the Bank will purchase ERs through 2012 from the two participating companies.
    The Bank has worked with the Government of China to ensure that they set aside a significant portion
of the HFC-23 revenues (65%) to establish a Sustainable Development Facility which would finance
further emission reduction projects, consistent with the CAS and with China's 11th Five Year Plan
priorities. Projects and activities funded by the SDF are not part of the project, which is limited to the
purchase of emissions and the provision of technical assistance for establishment and initial operation of
the Facility.

    A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis.
    The HFC-23 reduction will be carried out at the existing sites of the Changshu 3F and Jiansu Meilan
    Companies, which produce HCFC-22 in addition to many other chemical products and intermediates.
    Therefore the project does not involve any land acquisition or resettlement of people.
          Changshu 3F is located in an industrial park, which was established by the Government in 1999 on a
    5.2 km2 of land reclaimed from the former bed of the Yangzte River. Currently, the industrial park
    includes 10 companies, all of which are involved in fluorochemical production and four of which are of
    large size. Changshu 3F occupies 300,000 m2 of land and is involved in the production of anhydrous HF,
    HFC-152a, HCFC-142b, HFC-32, HFC-125, HCFC-22, TFE, TFP, and HFC-227. There are no critical
    natural habitats close to the plant site. The closest surface water is Fushan Canal, which is parallel to the
    southern and eastern boundaries of the Changshu 3F site at a distance of approximately 30 meters. The
    canal is connected to the Yangzte River, which is 4 km north of the site. The site is approximately 2 km
    west of Fushan Village (with a population of 4,000) and 20 km southwest of Changshu City. The shallow
    groundwater, which is 1-3 meters below the ground level with a depth of 6 meters, has no current use; its
    quality is not known although no spills have been reported from the Changshu 3F site. The plant area has
    not been subject to flooding or earthquake. No damage to the plant installations have resulted from
    typhoons (which occur about 1.5 times per year) or hails (which occur about once a year).
         Jiangsu Meilan occupies 667,000 m2 in an industrial park, where 10 companies (including a large
    petrochemical company) are located. At this site, Jiangsu Meilan produces a variety of chemical products
    (e.g. caustic soda, aniline, organic silicon, polytetrafluoroethylene, KFM, and PVC) and chemical
    intermediates (such as chlorine, hydrochloric acid, hysdrofluoric acid, anhydrous hydrogen fluoride,
    methylene chloride, chloroform, HCFC-22, tetrafluoroethylene, perfluoropropene, chloroethylene). There
    are no critical natural habitats close to the plant site. The closest surface water is a canal along the northern
    boundary of the site. This canal is connected to the Yingling River, which is to the west of the site. The
    nearest residential area is the housing complex established by Jiangsu Meilan for its employees (currently
    500 people live in this complex). Downtown Taizhou City is approxiumately 6 km southeast of the site.
    The shallow groundwater is 12 cm to 56 cm below the ground level and has no current use; its quality is not
    known although no spills have been reported from the Jiangsu Meilan site. The plant area has not been
    subject to flooding, earthquakes, or typhoons.

                            ISDS: China HFC-23 Emission ReductionsProject - October 28, 2005



D.1. (a) Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The Bank's environmental and social safeguards for companies participating in this project will apply to
the HFC-23 reduction schemes and the underlying HCFC-22 production processes. No Bank safeguard
policy is triggered except for OP4.01, Environmental Assessment. An environmental assessment (EA) is
being conducted for each HFC-23 investment facility. In addition, as the HFC-23 gas is generated from
the HCFC-22 production facilities, environmental due diligence assessments of the HFCFC-22 production
and associated storage and waste management facilities at these two companies was also carried out.
    As the HFC-23 emission reductions project is dictated by the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol, only
those HCFC-22 production facilities which were commissioned before December 31, 2001 were selected
within the physical boundary of the due diligence environmental assessment, and the corresponding HFC-
23 gas flow rates are considered for determining the capacity of the HFC-23 emission reductions. These
HCFC-22 facilities correspond to Lines A and B at Changshu 3F and Plants A and B at Jiangsu Meilan's
HCFC-22 production facilities.

EA for the HFC-23 Investments. The EA for each of the two HFC-23 emission reduction facilities was
prepared by the Chinese Academy of Environmental Sciences and China Green Enterprises, Ltd. according
to terms of reference (ToR) agreed by the two participating companies, FECO/SEPA, and the World Bank.
    Each EA describes the site and its surroundings (and will include a map), the HFC-23 reduction process
and its environmental discharges (air, wastewater, and solid waste discharges), impacts of these discharges
on receptors, safety-related issues (e.g. spills, explosions, fires) associated with the handling of process
chemicals (e.g. alkali) and wastes. The EAs also evaluate alternatives and propose environmental
mitigatory measures for environmental discharges and safety-related issues. Each EA includes an
environmental management plan (EMP) that describes the organizational structure (including staff
responsibilities) for environmental management, and training needs and arrangements for environmental
personnel at each facility, as well as a plan for monitoring environmental discharges (types of pollutants to
be monitored, type (continuous vs. grab sampling) and frequency of monitoring, and the recordkeeping and
reporting procedures to be followed. Drafts of the EAs have been prepared and reviewed by the Bank.
Final reports are expected by end October.
   Two public consultations were conducted for each project, the first one to discuss the project and the
second one to discuss the results of the EA. The meetings for the Jiangsu Meilan project were held on
August 26 and September 16; the meetings for Changshu 3F were held on September 2 and 26. Statistics
on the participants were conducted. In both cases, participants were supportive and did not raise concerns.
Final versions of the EAs and the due diligence assessments are expected by October 28, 2005. They will
be disclosed through the Bank's PIC in Washington, D.C. and in Beijing, and at the two sites.
    In the incineration of HFC-23, formation of dioxins/furans is a possibility under non-ideal operating
conditions because the feed gas to the incinerator would contain small amounts (less than about 10 percent)
of chlorine-bearing organic compounds. However, this possibility is remote because: (i) the process design
is based on an incineration temperature of 1,200oC and a residence time of 1.6-2.0 seconds; (ii) the inputs to
the incinerator are all in gaseous phase, which would enhance the destruction efficiency; and (iii)
incineration gases are washed with water and an alkali before being emitted to the atmosphere. In case of
upset process conditions, mitigatory measures are available (e.g. the feed to the incinerator would be
automatically shut off, and the gases from the system can be collected in a storage tank).

Environmental Due Diligence Assessments for the HCFC-22 Production Facilities. As the HCFC-22
production facilities occupy only a small fraction of the entire participating company sites, where
production of many other products also take place, the boundary for the HCFC-22 production activities was
defined to include: (i) the storage areas for the HCFC-22 process raw materials, products, by-products, and
waste storage areas, (ii) the HCFC-22 production facilities, (iii) the HCFC-22 waste management facilities
(e.g. incineration, wastewater treatment, and landfill facilities) that are owned or operated by each
participating company, and (iv) non-physical systems such as environmental management, monitoring
systems and emergency procedures adopted by each participating company. The due diligence
environmental assessment is based on written and verbal information provided by the participating
company officials, in response to the Due Diligence Environmental Assessment Protocol designed by the
World Bank, and additional information obtained by a World Bank mission during the site visit of the two
companies in August 2005. No large-scale, significant or irreversible impacts have been identified from
the HCFC-22 production facilities. Measures to strengthen current weaknesses have been identified, will
be discussed with the companies, and included in an agreed Action Plan. The EMP and the Action Plan
will be referenced in the ERPAs to be signed with the two companies.

D.1 (b). Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy
or due to multiple project component
There are no known potential cumulative negative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard
policy or multiple project components.
D.1c. Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No indirect and/or long-term impacts have been identified due to HFC-23 emission reduction investments.
D.2. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) (to be updated after pre-appraisal mission)
Alternative options have been identified and are being assessed with respect to the following:
- Process options for HFC-23 emission reduction. The following options are being considered: (i) without
the project option, (ii) incineration, (iii) process optimization, and (iv) process optimization combined with
incineration. The EAs are being revised to clearly reflect this analysis.
- Control of air pollutants (e.g. dioxins) during steady-state as well as non-steady-state (i.e. during process
start-up, process shut-down, and upset process conditions). The following options are being considered:
(i) no gaseous emissions controls, (ii) installation of a duplicate (i.e. parallel) gas cleanup system, and (iii)
installation of storage capacity to capture the pollutants which would otherwise be emitted to the
atmosphere. The final version of the EAs will reflect this analysis.
- Wastewater discharges. The following options are being considered: (i) no wastewater controls (i.e.
direct discharge to the surface water), (ii) use of a dedicated wastewater treatment system for the HFC-23
emission reduction plant with the discharge of the treated waters to the surface water, (iii) use of a
dedicated wastewater treatment system for the HFC-23 emission reduction plant with the discharge of the
treated waters to the entire facility's wastewater treatment plant, and (iv) discharge to the entire facility's
wastewater treatment plant. For options (ii) and (iii), alternative process schemes (e.g. type of dewatering
equipment) and/or treatment chemicals (e.g. NaOH, KOH) are being evaluated. For options (iii) and (iv),
the impact of HFC-23 treated waters/untreated wastewaters on the design and operating conditions of the
entire facility's wastewater treatment plant are being evaluated.
- Solid waste discharges. Hazardousness or non-hazardousness of the wastewater treatment sludge is
being discussed. At a minimum, the following options will be considered if the sludge is determined to be
non-hazardous: (i) use as input material to the cement kiln, (ii) use as input material for road construction,
and (iii) landfilling.
D.3. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
a) Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01)
FECO engaged a consultant team to prepare an EA for the HFC-23 reduction investment project at each
participating company. The consultant ToRs for these EAs were reviewed and agreed by FECO,
participating companies, and the Bank. Drafts of the EAs and their Environmental Management Plans
(EMPs) have been prepared and were reviewed by the Bank. Proposed revisions are under discussion.
Final drafts are expected by end October. In addition, the World Bank conducted a due diligence
assessment of the HCFC-22 production systems at these two companies.
    The safeguards issues to be addressed under these projects will be specified as the Environmental
Management Plans of the EAs. The recommendations of the due diligence environmental assessments will
be taken into account in the agreed Action Plans. Capacities of the participating companies to implement
the safeguard issues have been assessed, and recommendations for further strengthening have been
prepared. Both companies are ISO-14000 certified and are in compliance with relevant Chinese
environmental regulations. During project implementation, each participating company will ensure
operation of the HCFC-22 production and HFC-23 reduction facilities in compliance with the applicable
environmental and occupational health and safety regulations. Discharge monitoring and reporting will be
in accordance with the requirements established in the EMP/EA for the participating companies.

D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders of the project's investment component will be the Government of China, the
provincial/local government authorities, and HCFC-22 production companies. The project is not expected
to adversely impact the local population because: (i) the potentially adverse impacts will be mitigated
through proper project design in terms of selection of technologies, equipment, and process control/safety
measures, and (ii) proper training of the operating personnel. In addition, the HCFC-22 production and
HFC-23 emission reduction facilities are far away from residential areas.
