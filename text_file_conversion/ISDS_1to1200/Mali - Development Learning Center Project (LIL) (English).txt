resource requirements for the DLC. It will be implemented by the Project Coordination.

(ii) DLC Operations Support:         The component will in effect operationalize the DLC and assist in
establishing its viability and training program. It will be implemented by the DLC.

(iii) Monitoring & Evaluation: This component will be managed by the Project Coordination with
considerable input and collaboration from the DLC.

Components:

1. Construction & Installation      $1.20m
2. DLC Operation & Support          $1.15m
3. Monitoring & Evaluation          $0.15m


I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The Development Learning Center will be built in a new neighborhood called ACI 2000 within the former
Bamako International airport area. Not too far from downtown, ACI 2000 is expected to host most of the
business and administrative buildings. High level training institutions are located in this area.

The Development Learning Center will be a small one or two-story building (one videoconference room,
one multimedia room, offices and a reception area). The plot of land chosen by the Government for the

                                                        2
                                                                                                          ISDS


construction will be about 15,000 square feet, this plot of land is in a not environmentally sensitive area,
no one lives in this area as all the already-constructed buildings are mainly offices.

The civil works will be supervised by AGETIPE-Mali which will ensure that all building standards will be
followed. The construction will not use any toxic materials in operation or construction. Water, sanitation
and waste will be taken care of by both the public services and the contractor for civil works (this area will
be the property of the Government of Mali).

Given the very small size of the construction, the civil works will last for less than 8 months.
