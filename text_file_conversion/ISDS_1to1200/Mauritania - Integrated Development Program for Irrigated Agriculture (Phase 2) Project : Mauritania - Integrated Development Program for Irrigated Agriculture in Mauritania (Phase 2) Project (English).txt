A.2. Project Objectives 
The development objectives of Phase II are to (i) consolidate incentive measures, (ii) 
increase sustainable irrigation infrastructure, and (iii) intensify agricultural diversification 
for targeted actors engaged in irrigated agriculture.  These objectives build on the 
achievements of phase I to further the objective of the overall 3-phase program.  The 
success of the phase II hinges on the attainment of the following key outcome indicators: 
(i) rice import tariffs are maintained or reduced throughout phase II; (ii) regional land 
registries allow verification of land awards on request; (iii) the rural credit agency 
maintains a financial self-sufficiency; (iv) sustainable irrigation schemes are increased by 
3,000 ha by the end of phase II; (v) irrigated area under diversified crops has doubled by 
the end of phase II. 
Phase II starts under favorable auspices.  The rehabilitation pipeline holds some 700 
ha.  
A
rehabilitation-specific procurement plan has been developed to ensure that no 
rehabilitation gets bogged down during the rainy season.  About 36,000 ha (although 
mostly in the lower valley) have been registered during phase I and could be eligible for 
investment credit.  New arrangements are already being put in place to deal with the 
bottlenecks experienced during phase I, i.e., effective coordination of the PIU (ensuring 
availability and timeliness of matching grants) with the Bureau of Land Affairs (timely 
land registration for interested beneficiaries), SONADER (effective technical oversight) 
and UNCACEM (access to credit). 
Page  2
The triggers for moving from Phase II to Phase III have been also adjusted to reflect the 
results of phase I, add clarity to their measurement, and commit the Government to 
effectively tackle the major risks that can realistically be overcome during phase II.  The 
triggers are as follows: 
(T1) measures promoting competitive road transport services are fully implemented, 
as set in the PRSC; 
(T2) awards of irrigated land concessions are transparent and in accordance with 
land tenure legislation and the land use studies (
schemas de structure
); 
(T3) the charter of procedures for water and O&M charges of public infrastructure is 
implemented by SONADER and producers organizations. 
(T4) UNCACEM is reimbursing the Government line of credit. 
 
The project is fully aligned with the country's sector strategies and overall Poverty 
Reduction Strategic Framework.  It constitutes an implementation tool of the Country 
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY03-05.  The project addresses the enduring fact, 
highlighted in the CAS, that Mauritania’s poor disproportionately live in rural areas.  The 
Bank intends to gradually phase-in Poverty Reduction Strategic Credits (PRSC) in 
Mauritania, but will still continue to support selected investment projects that directly 
target poverty reduction, institutional strengthening and capacity building.  The PDIAIM 
is one such project. 
Through increased incomes and employment and the improvement of natural resource 
management in irrigated areas, the program will also contribute to two Millennium 
Development Goals (MDG): (i) eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, and (ii) ensuring 
environmental sustainability in rural areas. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
A.3. Project Description 
The components of phase I have been consolidated for flexibility in implementing phase 
II.  
Component A:  Rural Incentives and Capacity Building
 
(USD: 2.200 M
).  It aims at 
(1) consolidating the policy measures and incentives initiated during phase I, and (2) 
improving the capacity of rural institutions to implement the Program.  It targets (a) 
public providers of services to policymakers and agricultural producers, such as MDRE’s 
policy analysis and monitoring, land tenure registration, agricultural research/extension, 
environment, and seed  quality control; (b) the key autonomous implementing agencies 
(SONADER, UNCACEM); and (c) producers organizations at the national and regional 
levels, such as the Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (UCA); Mauritanian Federation of 
Crop and Livestock Producers (FAEM), and the Economic Interest Groups (GIES) of rice 
Page  3
marketing and F&L export cooperatives.  This component will finance (i) consultant 
services for surveys and analyses 
of the sector’s competitiveness and implementation of 
land tenure; (ii) training programs; (iii) limited equipment and office supplies for public 
agencies and farmers organizations; and (iv) some operational costs in support to these 
organizations and a performance-contract with the Bureau of Land Affairs (BAF) to 
ensure timely and transparent land titling of schemes to be rehabilitated or extended. 
Component B:  Infrastructure for Irrigated Agriculture (USD 13.300 M):
 
This key 
and largest component of phase II aims primarily at providing investment fund and 
technical services to land owners to contribute, along with secure land tenure and 
capacity building provided in other components, to expand irrigation infrastructure.  It 
focuses on (1) the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of private irrigated 
schemes development initiated during phase; (2) priority public infrastructure identified 
in studies carried out during phase I, including Foum Gleita dam safety measures ; (3) 
critical rural road works to improve access to irrigated schemes; (4) experimentations in 
water pumping for increased efficiency; and (5) feasibility studies of investments to be 
implemented during phase III.  It targets cooperatives as well as interested small private 
individual farmers engaged in rice production and agricultural diversification.  It will 
finance (i) private and public infrastructure investments; (ii) supervisory services 
provided by SONADER’s rehabilitation unit through a performance-contract; and (iii) 
studies.  The investment cost for private irrigated schemes includes beneficiary’s 
contribution, credit (through UNCACEM), and a one-time matching-grant. 
Component C:  Support to Agricultural Supply Chains. (USD 5.500 M):
 It aims at 
providing the necessary assistance to the development of a competitive rice subsector and 
a
diversified agricultural base (crops, livestock-related activities, forestry), targeting rice 
and horticultural supply chain participants engaged in domestic and export markets. The 
component comprises the following sub-components:  
C1: Support to Basic Farm Management.  
It aims at meeting the demands for 
agricultural technical and managerial support services of target beneficiaries.  These 
include (a) base-cooperatives farmers, (b) private individual farmers, and (c) small 
women cooperatives engaged in crop diversification.  It will finance key extension 
services and farm management training programs to be provided on a contractual 
basis by SONADER, NGOs and private service suppliers. 
C2:  Support to Rice Subsector. 
 It focuses on the continued improvement of the 
domestic rice subsector, targeting seed farmers, rice producers, processors, providers 
of agricultural custom services, and the rural credit agency.  It will finance the 
incremental needs of UNCACEM to provide short, medium and long-term credit to 
the sector’s participants. 
C3:  Promotion of Agricultural Diversification. 
 It aims primarily at increasing the 
participation of actors in commercial horticultural production for domestic and 
export markets, by taking advantage of new irrigation schemes financed under 
component B and the achievements of phase I.  (These achievements include cold 
storage and packaging infrastructure built at Nouakchott’s airport and at Rosso, 
creation of two producers/exporter GIEs, introduction of new irrigation systems and 
pilot activities regional and international market.)  It emphasizes the (1) development 
Page  4
of storage infrastructure to tap opportunities in the Haut-Fleuve; (2) efficient 
management of project-built infrastructure; (3) introduction of new products and 
processing techniques; (4) development and dissemination of good practices in the 
production and handling of F&V; (5) food quality control system; and (6) market 
information system.  It targets farmers and entrepreneurs engaged in horticultural 
and animal feed production for the domestic and export markets.  It supports (i) civil 
works, (ii) consultant services, including an international assistance, (iii) matching 
grants in pilot introduction programs and credit (through UNCACEM) to finance 
production and market operations; and (iv) limiting operating costs to support 
experimentations in irrigation systems through performance contracts with 
SONADER and CNRADA.  
Component D:  Project Administration (USD 4.000 M):
 It aims at ensuring the proper 
coordination of project activities, implementation of the social and environmental 
safeguards, and the monitoring of activities and evaluation of impacts. It includes the 
following sub-components: 
D1:  Project Management and Coordination.  
This supports activities related to the 
project’s administration and coordination, including its communication policy.  It will 
finance (i) training programs for capacity building, (ii) equipment, office supplies, 
and computerized financial management system, and (iii) operating costs of the PIU. 
 
D2: Environmental and Social Safeguard Measures:  
It
 
aims at ensuring the 
implementation of the environmental and social safeguard measures identified in the 
three safeguard documents.  The central PIU will implement these mitigating 
measures through, and in collaboration with, public agencies (Direction of 
Environment, Health, and others), NGOs and private firms as needed.  It will finance 
(i) civil works, (ii) consultant services, (iii) equipment and offices supplies, (iv) 
operating costs, and eventually (v) compensation payments as will be determined by 
the safeguard documents before appraisal. 
D3: Monitoring and Evaluation
.
It aims at strengthening project management, 
reporting and monitoring of project’s outcomes, triggers, safeguards and results.  The 
project emphasizes an effective yet simple M&E system that is readily appropriated 
by implementing agencies and the Government.  The KPI are assessed by quantitative 
measures or qualitative observations, based on clearly defined data collection 
instruments and analytical methods detailed in the Manual of procedures.  The system 
relies on the PIU’s M&E unit, but also collaborative third parties (e.g., World Bank’s 
PREM and local agencies) to provide an objective assessment of the project’s 
performance and the overall PDIAIM’s impact.  The project will finance (i) 
consultant services, (ii) equipment, office supplies, and computerized network, 
including a rural GIS, and (iii) operating costs.  The M&E unit is expected to produce 
timely periodic reports that benefit all key stakeholders.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
a
ny potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts include environmental 
degradation (waterlogging, salinization), aquatic weed infestation, water borne diseases.  
Phase II triggers the same safeguard policies that were treated during phase I.  For phase 
II, ASPEN has requested Mauritania to prepare an updated Environmental Assessment 
(
OP
/
BP
/
GP
4.01), which also addresses issues in Natural Habitats (
OP
/
BP
4.04), Cultural 
Property (
OPN 11.03
,
being revised as OP 4.11), Safety of Dams (
OP
/
BP
4.37), and 
Projects on International Waterways (
OP
/
BP
/
GP
7.50).  ASPEN also requested a  Pest 
Management Plan (
OP 4.09
)
and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) in line with the 
Involuntary Resettlement (
OP
/
BP
4.12).  The location of irrigation investments is not yet 
known because it is demand-driven, thus the RPF.  It is not anticipated that these 
investments lead to involuntary relocation or new land acquisition, but should such a 
possibility arises, a resettlement action plan with accompanying budget will be prepared.  
The Safety of Dam (OP/BP 4.37) was triggered because the Foum Gleita dam (built in 
1983) up north the project area could eventually provide water downstream to project-
financed schemes.  The Dam Safety inspection (auscultation) performed in January-
February 2004 on Foum Gleita found the dam safe overall. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
No significant indirect, long-term impacts in addition of the potential directs impacts 
addressed in D1 above are anticipated.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
N/A 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The Environmental and Social Assessment, the Resettlement Policy Framework, and the 
Pest Management Plan have been prepared and include the following: (i) systematization 
of environmental impact assessment for all identified sub-projects before entering into a 
funding agreement with communities; (ii) training of staff and partners of the national 
and regional coordination units; (iii) establishment and implementation of an intersect 
consultation framework for the environmental control and monitoring; (iv) reinforcement 
of coordination meetings of harmonization and consultation at all levels among 
stakeholders; and (vi) concerted efforts of NGOs and mass media for the execution of an 
Information-Education-Communication program aimed at improving environmental 
management.  The Dam Safety Plan, which is made of the recommendations of the 
inspection, will be implemented under component B of the PDIAIM (pr
iority public 
Page  7
infrastructure identified in studies carried out during phase I). Annex 6 summarizes the 
actions to be taken. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The Environmental and Social Assessment, the Resettlement Policy Framework, and the 
Pest Management Plan have all been disclosed both in country and at the Infoshop.  The 
project management unit will implement the safeguard measure through public agencies 
such as the Environment Department of the Ministry of Rural Development and the 
Environment (MDRE) and the Health Department, other agencies, NGOs and private 
providers as will be called for. 
 
As indicated earlier, a Dam Safety inspection (by Lahmeyer International and its local 
partner, SCET 
–
RIM) found that the Foum Gleita Dam is safe
.
Final results of the 
auscultation, made available since June 2004 in print and on CD ROM in Mauritania and 
to IDA, will be disclosed anew in-country and at the Infoshop.
