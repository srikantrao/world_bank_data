B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The project has two development objectives. 
·
Waterway users along the Han River will benefit from cost-effective, predictable, 
and increased transport capacity. 
·
The Xiangfan City Area and the Tandong Farmland Region will use sustainable 
hydropower and water resources. 
 
The project will produce the following outputs. 
·
Navigation
–
The proposed lock and 33-km long reservoir will accommodate 
1,000-ton capacity vessels. Currently 100 to 150-ton capacity vessels can navigate 
the same section. 
·
Power
-
415
MWh of hydropower per year will be provided to Xiangfan City. 
(Optimization of power production may result in an increase to approximately 
460 MWh per year with a marginal increase in cost and a reduction in unit cost.) 
·
Water resources
-
Water will be provided for domestic, industrial, and agricultural 
uses (irrigation of 1.77 million mu of farmland) in the Xiangfan region.

C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The Han River is the largest and possibly the most important tributary of the Yangtze River. 
From its source in Shaanxi Province, it flows into the Yangtze at Wuhan in Hubei Province, a 
distance of about 1,567 km. Approximately the last 1,313 km is navigable, of which 455 km is in 
Shaanxi and 858 km in Hubei. 
 
The 2020 long-term comprehensive development plan for the Han River calls for upgrading the 
navigation channel to accommodate 500-ton capacity vessels (Grade III) from above the existing 
Danjiangkou complex in Hubei Province upstream to the existing Ankang reservoir in Shaanxi 
Province and 1,000-ton capacity vessels (Grade IV) from below the Danjiangkou Complex to the 
Yangtze River.  The proposed Complex is 142 km downstream from the Danjiangkou Complex.  
This will be achieved through the construction of a total of 16 navigation complexes (dams 
combining a shiplock and power plant), of which nine are in Hubei Province (see Annex 2). The 
proposed Cuijiaying Complex will be the fifth such complex to be built on the Han River, and 
the third within Hubei. 
 
In the short term, from completion of the proposed project (approximately 2010) to 2020, 
operational capacity will be constrained to 500-ton capacity vessels upstream of the  Complex to 
the Danjiangkou Complex and downstream to the Yangtze River. The 2020 ultimate capacity of 
1,000-ton capacity vessels will be realized in 2020 upon completion of adjoining projects. 
The long-term development for the Han River includes additional cargo terminals at the various 
ports along the Han River. Six new 500-ton capacity berths (for containers, bulks and timber) are 
to be completed by 2010. 
 
Currently 90% of the inland waterway freight transport in China consists of dry bulks.  Inland 
waterway transport is ideal for low-value freight that is not time sensitive such as dry bulks.  In 
the region of Xiangfan the dry bulks transported by waterway consists of coal, ore, sand, stone, 
and brick.  The current waterway is congested with demand exceeding capacity.  The 2003 
modal split for the project area was 9% inland waterway, 75% highway, and 16% rail.  The 
reservoir will introduce a higher degree of predictability and capacity for larger vessels reducing 
unit costs of transport. This is expected to result in an increase of traffic and possible transfer of 
lower-value dry bulks from highway to waterway transport. 
 
The project’s consists mainly of the construction of the Cuijiaying Navigation and Power 
Complex. This Complex includes the following elements: 
 
·
Ship lock 
·
Hydropower Plant (generation) 
·
Sluice Gates 
·
Earthen Dam 
·
Reservoir 
·
Embankment works 
·
Access road and bridge crossing the river 
·
Administration facility 
·
Environmental and resettlement component addressing related impacts.

·
Han River Long-term Development Planning
–
including the planning of the 
remaining 11 hydropower complexes 
·
Waterway Transportation Market Enhancement
–
including multi-modal 
transportation services and fleet modernization; 
·
Power Pricing and Management
–
including recommendations for managing an 
independent power producer in a competitive power market.

IBRD has been asked to finance US$100-120 million, 45% to 54% of the estimated project cost. 
The remaining financing will be by Hubei Province and the National Government.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The World Bank has financed four highway projects with Hubei Communications Department.   
Through the preparation and implementation of these projects, Hubei Communications 
Department has significantly enhanced its capacity to address safeguard issues, including staff 
appointment and training.  Nevertheless, the proposed project is also the first time for the 
department to deal with reservoir resettlement.  This is also the first World Bank financed project 
for Xiangfan Government, who is a key partner in the project implementation.   Capacity build-
up efforts will be planned as part of the project preparation.

[Environment] 
The TOR of the EIA has been approved by the Bank.  The borrower is now preparing EIA and 
EAP, which will be submitted to the Bank before the pre-appraisal mission.  So far, no critical 
natural habitats have been identified and there is no nature protected areas around the project 
impacted area. 
 
[Social] 
The project will require land acquisition, relocation of structures and infrastructure for the 
reservoir, dam construction and ancillary works.  A resettlement action plan is being prepared to

address the involuntary resettlement issues.  This plan is expected to be completed and submitted 
to the Bank for review before mid-September 2004. 
 
The project area is not known statistically to have ethnic minority communities.  This is also 
confirmed by the Bank preparation mission.  A social assessment is planned to be conducted 
under this project and it will help further confirm this general understanding.  If the social 
assessment concludes otherwise, it will recommend necessary measures in line with World Bank 
policy on indigenous people. 
 
Given the long and rich history of the project area, the project is expected to have impacts on 
cultural relics, particularly those underground.  Hubei Provincial Cultural Relics and 
Archaeology Institute will be engaged to carry out the impact assessment and develop protection 
and restoration measures.  These measures will be incorporated in the project EA.
