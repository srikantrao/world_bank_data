                           B. Project Objectives
                           The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase employment and earnings
                           opportunities for targeted youths.

                           The beneficiaries of the project will be youths aged between 16 and 29 years of age who are jobless
                           and have experienced extended spells of unemployment or who are currently working in vulnerable
                           jobs defined as those working on their own account, a contributing family member, or working for
                         wages in a household enterprise with fewer than 10 workers. During preparation the target group
                         will be further refined to promote access for women and disadvantaged youth.
                         C. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The Project proposes a market-driven approach to increasing the employment and earnings
                         opportunities of youth beneficiaries. Its scope will be national with an effort to reach youths in all
                         regions and counties. Positive values for the Project’s KPIs will be achieved by strengthening and
                         expanding active labor market programs that have already been carefully evaluated in Kenya and
                         similar country settings and have been shown to be effective in increasing youth employability and
                         promoting job creation and productive employment. Active labor market programs include all social
                         expenditures other than education aimed at improving the prospects of beneficiaries finding gainful
                         employment or otherwise increasing their earning capacity.

                         The Project will address employment issues for youths on both the supply and demand sides of the
                         labor market as well as issues affecting the intermediation of these markets. The issues affecting
                         youth employment and the realization of Kenya’s youth dividend include: (i) slow macroeconomic
                         growth and job creation; (ii) labor regulations that discourage job creation in the formal wage sector;
                         (iii) the resulting large share of employment in the informal sector with its low productivity and
                         earnings; (iv) the lack of the technical and behavioral skills sought by employers among job seekers;
                         (v) training institutions that lack the curricula and instructional capacity to meet the demands of the
                         market; and (vi) the absence of adequate labor market information to match labor demand and supply
                         and to enable the planning of future investments in skills development.

                         The four components of the Project will focus on youths who are experiencing difficulty in finding
                         employment and youths who are employed in the informal sector with its low productivity and
                         earnings. Component 1 will address issues on the supply side of the labor market involving
                         insufficient skills and job readiness by offering training and work experience modeled after the
                         Kenya Youth Empowerment Project (KYEP). Component 2 will address issues on the demand side
                         of the market by helping youths to launch new business startups and to expand the potential of

                         informal sector enterprises to create jobs. Component 3 will aim to expand the availability of and
                         access to labor market information for employers, job seekers, training institutions, and
                         policymakers. Component 4 will strengthen institutional capacity for the implementation of Project
                         services, support youth labor market policy development through studies and workshops, provide
                         project management, and carry out monitoring and evaluation activities, including an impact
                         evaluation of the interventions supported under Component 2. Component 4 will also finance further
                         analysis of Kenya’s current labor regulations and their impact on youth employment. The Ministry of
                         Devolution and Planning will be responsible for the overall implementation, coordination, and
                         supervision of the Project working with various partners including the National Industrial Training
                         Authority (Component1), the Micro and Small Enterprise Authority (Component 2), and the Ministry
                         of Labor, Social Security, and Services (Component 3).
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The beneficiaries of the Project will be youths 16-29 years old who are jobless and have experienced
                         long spells of unemployment, or who are currently working in vulnerable jobs, defined as those
                         working on their own account, a contributing family member, or working for wages in a household's
                         enterprise with workers.

                         At this stage, the Project is likely to have a national scope, meaning that all counties in the country
                           will be included in the Project. It will ensure that vulnerable groups or marginalized youth groups
                           benefit from funds provided under the project.

                           The Project activities almost exclusively relate to skills development, work placement and capacity
                           building of the youth. Specifically, in relation to Component 2: Job Creation, the Project will not
                           directly finance the establishment of small business amongst beneficiaries, rather it will enhance their
                           capacities to successfully access knowledge and financing from existing institutions.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The Ministry of Devolution and Planning (MoDP) will be responsible for the overall implementation,
                           coordination, and supervision of the Project. The MoDP will work with (a) The National Industrial
                           Training Authority (NITA), The Micro and Small Enterprise Authority (MSEA) (to be confirmed),
                           and the Ministry of Labor, Social Security, and Services (MLSSS). Project preparation will include a
                           capacity assessment (by the World Bank) of the key institutions directly involved in delivering the
                           project (August-September 2015).
