A.2. Project Objectives
The Project development objective is to support the achievement of sustainable universal access to safe and
affordable water for the population of Guyana, especially the poor. This Project will also help to
consolidate the water sector modernization and reform process supported by IDA and other donors in
recent years. Specifically, the Project will:
*   Provide access to treated water to over 48,000 people through the development of treatment facilities
in the coastal water supply systems in regions 2, 3 and 5.
*   Improve levels of service to low and medium income housing schemes already connected to the
service.
*   Provide the technical assistance needed to allow for the sustainable development of water resources in
Guyana, and support the modernization and financial sustainability of GWI.
* Through the emergency component, provide funding to support recovery needs after the January 2005
floods.
The Project will contribute to the following three key higher-level objectives:
Achievement of MDG and PRSP targets: The Project will support the Government of Guyana in reaching
the MDG goals and its Poverty Reduction Strategy targets by extending access to safe' water to 48,000
people.
Relaxed WHO standard, the current national standard for Guyana
I



Health and environmental improvements: The Project is expected to bring health benefits to over 48,000
people by a reduction in morbidity and mortality related to water quality through the proper treatment of
drinking water and management of wastewater. Immediate health improvements (which would especially
benefit children who are often particularly susceptible to water-borne diseases) would include reductions in
gastrointestinal illnesses, cholera, typhoid and hepatitis, among others.
Poverty Reduction: The Project would positively impact poor households that are now boiling or
purchasing water from vendors (amongst other coping strategies). The percentage of people in Guyana
living below the poverty threshold is currently 33. 1 %.2 The Project targets largely rural and peri-urban
communities with a disproportionate number of poor residents.
A.3. Project Description
The Project will support the Government's Program through a Specific Investment Grant to be
implemented by GWI.3 The Grant will finance a capital investment component for the construction and
rehabilitation of three water supply infrastructure subprojects, each within an operating division of GWI,
and the corresponding design, project management and supervision activities. The Project will also finance
an institutional strengthening component and an emergency component to support reconstruction needs
after the January 2005 floods.
GWI will have overall technical responsibility for project implementation (including procurement). Table
I below summarizes the four components included in the overall Project:

a modern and efficient utility.
Component 4: Emergency Component (US$ 1.1 million, 100% IDA financed given the emergency
nature of the intervention): The component will finance emergency rehabilitation and technical assistance
investments associated with the January 2005 floods along the East Coast and West Coast of Demerara and
in Georgetown in order to restore the ability of GWI to supply potable water and to dispose of wastewater
in the affected areas.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The three water supply infrastructure subprojects will be build in a pre-identified number of urban and peri-
urban areas in Divisions 1, 2 and 4 of GWI (corresponding with regions 2, 3 and 5 of Guyana). Project
activities are not expected to face any unusual environmental risks and would generally constitute a
substantial positive environmental impact.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.I. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The proposed operation has been rated by QAT as category B for IDA processing purposes. Project
activities are not expected to face any unusual environmental risks and would generally constitute a
substantial positive environmental impact. The Project would support the Government's implementation of
the 1996 Environmental Protection Act. As part of project preparation, GWI and the Government have
developed Environmental Guidelines for Construction Projects and Corporate Environmental and Social
Guidelines. These Guidelines have been reviewed, commented on and signed off by the EPA
(Environmental and Protection Agency) of Guyana and can be found in the Project files.
The construction works to be financed will require compliance with guidelines and contractors will be
asked to develop Environmental Management Plans (EMP) to the satisfaction of GWI guidelines. All water
supply facilities will complement the operating manuals with corresponding site specific EMP. Under
these conditions the Project would not cause environmental damage, would strengthen EPA efforts to
implement the Environmental Act, and create a culture of environmental awareness and actions to
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties'
claims on the disputed areas

complement good management practices promoted by the Project.
In accordance with O.P. 4.01, the screening tool and Environmental Guidelines for Construction Projects
prepared as part of project preparation has been applied to the three investment subprojects to be financed
under the Project to produce the corresponding Environmental Assessments. The Environmental
Assessments exemplify the application of the screening tool developed. The Guidelines provide
recommendations to avoid, mitigate and ameliorate negative environmental impacts through the
development and implementation of EMPs to be prepared by the contractors and approved by GWI and by
IDA. The Guidelines and Environmental Assessments are available in the Project Files.
Public consultation and dissemination: In accordance with IDA requirements, the Government has
consulted and publicly disclosed the Environmental Guidelines for Construction Projects before its
approval by the Board of GWI.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area.
