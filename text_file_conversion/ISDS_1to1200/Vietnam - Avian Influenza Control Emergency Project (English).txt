Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project would overall have positive environmental and social impacts. The project’s 
environmental and social issues relate to two main activities:  
 
Building capacity for collection and testing of Avian Influenza virus. 
The project’s 
investments in facilities, equipment, and training for four regional (RVCs) and two 
national (NVDC and NIVR) laboratories will improve the effectiveness and safety over 
existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting international 
standards established by OIE (World Organization for Animal Health).  The project will 
also provide equipment for the Virus Reference Laboratory, within NIVR, to identify 
HPAI (the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus) and its strains in Vietnam. 
·
Construction phase
.
The small scale rehabilitation of laboratory facilities, not funded 
by IDA, will cause temporary impacts of vehicles and construction equipment.  The 
sites are already built-out and so there is no issue of habitat conversion.  The 
investments in the laboratory facilities expansion do not involve land acquisition.  
The expansion of lab space is minor, and would be accommodated within the existing 
developed areas of the research institutes.  
·
Operation phase
.
The laboratories already process specimens for AI testing, which 
may have potential health risks to laboratory staff.  The project would have a positive 
impact on laboratory staff safety by providing safe facilities for existing AI research 
and monitoring activities and building capacity for their use. The project would 
enable the adoption and use of OIE bio-safety standards for the handling, testing, and 
disposal of samples used for AI research.
 
Strategy Formulation
.
The project would assist the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural 
Development to develop a strategy for managing future AI outbreaks. The inclusion of 
this strategy in the project is an opportunity to improve its environmental and social 
sustainability, in two areas: (i) mainstreaming environmental safeguards into protocols 
and procedures for the culling and disposal of animals during an outbreak, in particular 
by adopting OIE standards in these areas; and (ii) development of GoV’s policy on 
compensation for poultry farmers affected by future outbreaks. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The project would not cause or contribute to long term or cumulative impacts.
 
Page  4
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
There are no viable long term alternatives to building capacity in Vietnam for testing for AI and instituting 
appropriate control mechanisms. In the short term to medium term, an alternative for testing will be to 
continue to rely on sending samples to laboratories outside of Vietnam (e.g., in Hong Kong and Australia).  
This, in fact, would continue until the capacity of the laboratories in Vietnam are operating fully under OIE 
standards. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The measures taken by the Borrower regarding safeguard issues are as follows:  
·
With regard to the temporary construction-related impacts, the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has sufficient experience with the 
environmental mitigation measures used to manage these, as they are commonly used 
in projects financed by GoV and World Bank. These mitigations will be included in 
the construction contracts. 
·
With regard to the human health issues arising from sample collection and testing for 
avian influenza, the issue of capacity and capability have been the subject of technical 
reviews by several agencies, including the WHO, FAO, and the CDC, with additional 
information collected by the preparation team. There is good capacity within the 
National Institute for Veterinary Research for the basic handling and typing of AI-
infected samples.  
 
The Borrower will need to address weaknesses in several areas related to safeguarding 
human health:  
·
Capacity is weak at the provincial to communal levels on procedures for handling and 
transporting samples to Hanoi and HCMC for testing. 
·
Improvements in lab facilities are needed to safeguard lab workers from possible 
HPAI infection.  
 
The project is specifically designed to build capacity in these areas, with investments in 
staff training to improve safety at all levels (from sample collection to testing and 
disposal) and to upgrade laboratory facilities.  The project would require adoption of and 
adherence to international standards for laboratory safety in accordance with OIE 
standards.  The project design includes technical assistance and independent inspection of 
the lab facilities and practices to ensure that the appropriate standards are met.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Stakeholders of the project include: (a) poultry farmers throughout Vietnam, and in particular those of the 
10 provinces where most of the project’s activities will be implemented; (b) consumers of poultry meat and 
eggs; (c) state institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the National 
Institute for Veterinary Research; and (d) and provincial and local officials.
