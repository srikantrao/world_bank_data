                           15.      The Project Development Objective is to promote the social and economic inclusion of at
                           least 3,000 conflict-affected Iraqi youth (ages 15-29) through engagement in entrepreneurship and
                           youth-led community development activities. This PDO is similar to that of the first JSDF pilot.
                           However, this second JSDF pilot responds to changed country circumstances and tests peace-
                           building approaches across diverse youth beneficiaries affected by radicalization and violent
                           extremism in mixed communities.

                           analysis (if known)
                           52.   The project area comprises three different districts in Baghdad: Al Sadr City, Zayona, and
                           Al-Amriya, which have been heavily affected by sectarian conflict.

                           53.      Safeguards-specific institutional arrangements will be mainstreamed within the PMU, which
                           will received direct training from World Bank safeguards specialists. In addition, project trainers will
                           assist youth groups to fill out and submit screening forms; the M&E officer will be responsible for
                           reviewing and filing all screening and implementation phase monitoring forms, and the MoYS
                           Oversight and Audit Department will be responsible for conducting an "spot-check" audit to ensure
                           that the M&E officer is collecting, reviewing, and filing all project selection/screening and
