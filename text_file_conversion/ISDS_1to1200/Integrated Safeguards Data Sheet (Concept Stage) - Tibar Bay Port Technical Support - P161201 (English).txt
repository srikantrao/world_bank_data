                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           Set up and operationalize the PMU and build its capacity for the management of the first PPP
                           concession contract in Timor-Leste. This support is envisaged to encompass capacity building and
                           transfer knowledge from international experts to local staff for long-term contract management.
                           C. Project Description
                           The Government of Timor-Leste has identified Tibar Bay, 14 km west of Dili, for the site of a
                           greenfield port handling only cargo operations. The new port will take all of Dili port➢❨ s cargo
                           operations and have a 350,000 TEU capacity. This will relieve congestion currently experienced at
                           the Dili port.

                           The Port PPP consists of the construction and operation of a new port at Tibar Bay, under a PPP
                           scheme, whereby public participation in the investment is expected to be partially funded by the WB
                           and ADB, and partially by the PF. The Tibar Bay Port is expected to be operational by end 2019 and
                           replace Dili Port as Timor Leste➢❨ s principal port for cargo and container operations. As Tibar Bay
                           becomes operational, Dili Port will only provide ferry and passenger vessels and space currently
                           occupied by cargo and container will be redeveloped as a public marina.
                         The Port PPP financial bid consisted of a single variable, the Viability Gap Financing (VGF) to be
                         contributed by the GoTL through a combination of their own resources, and credits/loans from the
                         WB and the ADB. The BollorÃ© offer established the VGF amount at US$129.45 million,
Public Disclosure Copy




                         significantly lower than IFC➢❨ s base case scenario. The VGF is to be paid to the concessionaire in
                         tranches, the first of which will be disbursed upon engineering design and mobilization. During
                         negotiations, it was agreed that the GoTL would escrow the full VGF amount, using resources from
                         the Petroleum Fund in order to cover the risk that the WB and ADB loans for the Port PPP are not
                         yet approved. As a result, the installments due to the concessionaire will be paid out of this escrow
                         account, and the proposed WB Port PPP operation will disburse as these installments are being paid,
                         for a total amount of up to USD 70 million (USD 10 million from the International Development
                         Association (IDA), USD 60 million from the International Bank for Reconstruction and
                         Development (IBRD), to be confirmed), along with the ADB (whose expected contribution amounts
                         to USD 59 million).

                         The WB➢❨ s proposed involvement on the Port PPP would have one component:

                         Infrastructure Development. Estimated funding of about US$350 million, of which US$170 million
                         would be funded by the WB. The proposed funds would form part of the GoTL➢❨ s Viability Gap
                         Financing for PPP for the Tibar Bay port. Money will be disbursed based on attainment of specific
                         construction milestones, certified by the Independent Engineer.

                         In order to support the Port PPP, under the proposed grant, GoTL is planning to hire both local and
                         international individuals with the relevant expertise for PMU establishment and operationalization
                         throughout the project cycle (including environmental and social safeguards). This is to ensure
                         transfer of knowledge from international to local individuals. This approach is appropriate based on
                         the previous PPIAF intervention in the country, which mobilized an international PPP Specialist to
                         build capacity of the PPP Unit staffed with five Timorese staff. This activity successfully facilitated
                         the PPP Unit to perform PPP pipeline identification and development and to implement tendering of
Public Disclosure Copy




                         the country's first PPP Concession for Tibar Bay Port.

                         The assistance is expected to be provided for the first two years of the Concession (from the signing
                         of the CA until the end of the first year of construction) to ensure the proposed PMU to be
                         operational. More specifically, this proposed assistance includes contract management of the CA,
                         staffing, review of design documents and construction supervision at the initial stage of construction.
                         The contract management support aims to ensure that the GoTL fulfills its contractual obligations
                         including the provision and timely disbursement of the VGF to be funded PF.

                         This assistance will in particular focus on the critical financial close phase. The As the CA was
                         signed on June 3rd 2016, the financial close is required to be reached no later than 11 months after
                         contract effectiveness, allowing construction start by the third quarter of 2017. In order to reach the
                         financial close, GoTL needs to fulfill some Conditions Precedent (including approval of concession
                         by the Auditors' Chamber of the Supreme Administrative, Tax and Auditing Court, granting access to
                         the Concession Area, execution of the Direct Agreements with the key subcontractors and the
                         lenders, appointment of the Independent Engineer jointly with the concessionaire).
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Tibar Bay, running approximately 1.6 km east-west and 1 km north-south, was selected by GoTL as
                         the most appropriate site for the new Port based on a range of considerations. Seven alternative port
                         site layouts were then considered within the Bay based on operational, engineering, environmental,
                         social and cost factors. The site was selected as the preferred site based on its operational suitability,
                         lower environmental and social impacts, and cost effectiveness. Port facilities are likely to consist of

                         a 26.9ha container terminal, 2.7ha general cargo area and 11.6ha for offices and workshops.

                         The direct, cumulative and induced potential social and environmental impacts of the Port PPP are
                         expected to be significant. The port will require the creation of a 200m wide approach channel
                         through the western side of the reef across the mouth of the bay, establishing a 600m diameter
                         turning circle within the bay, construction of a wharf, land reclamation and some landside
                         developments. The site will require the removal of around 20ha of marine habitat, most notably
                         consisting of approximately 18ha of seagrass bed, up to 1ha of live coral and between 1 and 3ha of
                         mangrove, depending upon the final design.

                         Potential social impacts will include land acquisition and resettlement (although this is expected to be
                         largely public land with only moderate direct impacts on private land), business and employment
                         impacts (at the site and at the existing Dili port), livelihood impacts on fishing communities, cultural
                         heritage sites, restricted access to the water, shoreline and marine area, safety and visual impacts.
                         Substantial indirect and induced impacts on adjoining and nearby land uses and environments are
                         also likely if not managed effectively.
                         E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The Concessionaire, BollorÃ© Logistics, is generally recognized as having the capacity to identify,
                         assess and manage environmental and social risks. The company➢❨ s Timor Leste operations are
                         certified under ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems), 14001 (Environmental Management) and
                         18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Standard). For the preparation of the Environmental and
                         Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), BollorÃ© has appointed a major international consulting firm
                         with a very strong track-record in undertaking large and complex assessments such as required for
                         this project.

                         During project preparation, the legal and institutional framework of relevant stakeholders
                         (particularly NDPCEI, Ministry of Lands, MoF ➢❨ the Loan and PPP Unit) will be assessed, along
                         with their capacity. If needed, a program to strengthen the safeguards implementation arrangements
                         will be designed. Special attention will be paid to identifying an implementation structure and
                         process to effectively interact with the social and environmental consultants appointed by the
                         concessionaire for the preparation of the safeguard documents and for project supervision and
                         monitoring.

                         The PMU will be staffed with experienced professionals that will combine the backgrounds needed
                         to manage the Concession Agreement (technical, concession/licensing, HSE, social safeguards, legal
                         and financial). The staffing process will be done in several phases to fit the needs, and is expected to
                         be completed before commencement of operations. The staffing plan was proposed under the
                         previous PPIAF assistance.

                         The PMU has already appointed one International and one National Safeguards specialist to add
                         capacity to better manage safeguards. In addition to this, this proposed PPIAF Grant is being
                         processed to support GoTL to set up and operationalize the PMU and build its capacity for the
                         management of the first PPP concession contract in Timor-Leste. This support is envisaged to
                         encompass capacity building and transfer knowledge from international experts to local staff for
                         long-term contract management.
