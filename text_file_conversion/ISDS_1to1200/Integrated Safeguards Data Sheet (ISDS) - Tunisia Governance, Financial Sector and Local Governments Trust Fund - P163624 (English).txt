                           C. Project Description
                           The RETF activities focus on procuring equipment for Tunisia’s central and local governments to provide
                           impoverished existing, or expanded municipalities as well as newly created municipalities to have minimum
                           material means to accomplish their missions as requested by law and to meet citizens’ expectations for
                           service provision.

                           With basic equipment supplies (such as desks, computers, telephones and fax, heating and air-conditioning),
                           these municipalities will be expected to have the physical ability to perform their function and to provide
                           expected services to citizens.

                           This will also create a working environment able to attract and retain needed skilled staff.
