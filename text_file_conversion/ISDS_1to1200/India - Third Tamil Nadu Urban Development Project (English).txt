A.2. Project Objectives 
The proposed repeater project would build on and consolidate the achievements of TNUDP II, continuing 
to improve urban infrastructure services in Tamil Nadu in a sustainable manner.   The two main objectives 
are: 
·
to strengthen the empowerment of ULBs by
 
continuing the decentralization process through delegation 
of powers from state level bodies to ULBs; and
 
through continuing and expanding the capacity 
building programs started under TNUDP II; and
 
·
to mobilize resources on a sustainable  basis for urban infrastructure investments through; 
-
mobilizing private financing for ULB infrastructure investments by linking ULBs to the financial 
markets  through the intermediation of the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF); 
-
providing incentives for investments in low income neighborhoods through the 
use of supporting capital grants. 
A.3. Project Description 
The project comprises of  two components (i) Institutional Development (ID) component and (ii) Urban 
Investment (UI) component.  
 
A. Institutional Development Component
:
The institutional development component focuses on 
advancing the urban sector reforms in Tamil Nadu, building capacity of urban local bodies, improving 
managerial and financial  performance of ULBs through performance benchmarking and  monitoring. 
 
B. Urban Investment Component:
 The urban investment component will aim at 
developing sustainable urban investments in water supply, waste water collection, solid 
waste management, storm water drains, roads and common facilities such as 
Page  2
transportation networks, and sanitation facilities,
 based on investment plans or  “City 
Visions” developed by ULBs. Primarily component  includes investment support to 
TNUDF through a line of credit and provision of grant funds to finance environmental 
and social mitigation actions and the capital grant element of sub-projects serving the 
lowest income groups.  However, in addition to the line of credit, project design would 
seek to expand TNUDF’s financial role to include credit enhancement support through 
other instruments—such as debt service reserve funds, partial guarantees, first loss 
guarantees, bond insurance  and subordinated debt instruments which would assist the 
overall objective of providing sustainable access to the capital markets and commercial 
financing to ULBs.  
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
Information on the exact locations of the subprojects to be financed under TNUDP III 
project is not known at this stage. However, these subprojects are expected to come up 
within the urban areas of Tamil Nadu.  
 
B. Check Environmental Category 
A
[], B [], C [ ], FI X] 
 
Comments: 
The subprojects to be financed under the project are likely to have varying levels of 
environmental impacts depending upon the location of subprojects, and scale and nature 
of activities envisaged in the subproject. Since the subprojects are restricted to urban 
areas, which have higher than  normal population density, the environmental impacts 
associated with the subproject activities are expected to be significant warranting proper 
assessment and mitigation.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
Social: 
Under  the previous project TNUDP-II, TNUDF had incorporated the suggestions made by the Bank to 
address issues related to social safeguard requirements of ESR in the context of OD 4.30 on Involuntary 
Resettlement.  Since social safeguard requirements of the Bank are currently based on OP 4.12 and BP 
4.12, TNUDF would update its ESR by replacing its existing Appendix  5 
–‘ Social Impact and Entitlement 
Framework for World Bank Financed Projects’ -
with a view to meet the Bank's current requirements.  
TNUDF would also strengthen its social safeguards framework by including  the field tested formats for 
social screening, classification of categories, reporting and monitoring.  Social safeguards in the proposed 
TNUDP III would relate to continued lending by TNUDF to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), up-gradation of 
services in low income areas and certain investments which are likely to emerge out ULB investment plans 
to be financed by TNUDF.  
Environment:  
The Project will directly contribute to the improvement of environmental conditions in urban areas by 
providing basic infrastructure, including solid-waste and sanitation facilities, storm drainage and water 
supply facilities. Nevertheless, some of the subproject types to be financed under the project are expected 
to have adverse environmental implications/issues requiring careful assessment and mitigation. As the 
issues/impacts are subproject specific, a framework approach is being  adopted to screen and mitigate the 
impacts at subproject level.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The project area is very wide since Tamil Nadu is one of the most urbanized states in 
India, and virtually spreads across the entire state of Tamil Nadu although confined  to 
urban areas. Future activities in such urban areas especially the towns and cities are 
expected to result in both positive and negative impacts. One of the significant negative 
impacts is expected to be the land use change in the long term.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant): NA 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The framework approach used in the previous TNUDP projects will continue to be used to identify and 
mitigate the potential negative environmental impacts of such sub-projects under TNUDP III As part of the 
preparation for TNUDP III, a comprehensive review of the existing environmental framework (titled 
Environmental and Social Report) has been undertaken to identify the gaps/concerns/inadequacies and 
opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of the framework. The updated framework  to be renamed as 
Environmental & Resettlement Framework (ERF) would have the following critical enhancements. 
 
·
Reflecting the regulatory changes related to environment in the context of the project and 
changes/updates in applicable Bank policies/guidelines. 
·
Strengthening the framework including formats for monitoring and reporting progress of EMP 
Page  5
implementation. 
·
Strengthening institutional and implementation framework including contractual obligations 
between the borrower (such as municipalities) and the civil contractors. 
·
Strengthening the policy framework to include environmental enhancement as part of environment 
management at sub project levels.  
 
Based upon the potential magnitude of environmental impacts involved, sub-projects 
would be  classified into three categories (E1 major impact, E2 moderate impact, and E3 
no impact) and appropriate mitigation and enhancement actions will be  included in sub-
project design. Assessment and studies will be undertaken to prepare subproject specific 
EA/EMPs for E1 projects. Each subproject, which is  classified as  E1 will be approved 
by the Bank during the sub-loan appraisal stage. 
 
To strengthen the institutional capacity, and to improve environmental management in 
TNUDP III, TNUIFSL will recruit an environment and resettlement manager (ERM) with 
the dedicated responsibility of overseeing the environment management process in 
TNUDP III. Suitable training and capacity building initiatives will be designed and 
implemented to ensure effective implementation of the ERF. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders include, the ULBs, line departments in the State Government 
responsible for providing different services in the urban areas, local NGOs, the people to 
be directly affected by subprojects and the urban population in general who are expected 
to benefit from the subprojects to be implemented as part of the project. The Environment 
and Resettlement Framework (ERF) developed for the project has necessary provisions to 
ensure consultation and participation at subproject level to address the safeguard issues. 
The Framework document w
ill be posted at TNUDF’s website and will be accessible to 
all stakeholders at key locations with summaries in the local language (Tamil).
