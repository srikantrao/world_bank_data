Public Disclosure Copy




                         Component 1 - Tinkhundla Infrastructure and Capacity Building Support

                          This component comprises two inter-dependent sub-components supporting eight Tinkhundla
                         located in peri-urban areas or rural growth nodes. The sub-components are: (a) Tinkhundla Basic
                         Infrastructure Financing, which consists of the provision of annual, performance-based capital
                         funding for small-scale public infrastructure, underpinned by (b) Tinkhundla Capacity Building
                         Support, which consists of on-the-job, just-in-time capacity building support provided by a mobile
                         mentoring team and designed to strengthen Tinkhundla capacity and facilitate the achievement of
                         performance requirements.

                          Component 2 - Urban Infrastructure Grants and capacity Building Support

                          Component 2 comprises two inter-dependent sub-components: (a) Performance-Based Infrastructure
                         Grants; and (b) Urban Local Government Capacity Building Support. The component is intended to
                         strengthen the ability of urban local governments to provide and sustain the delivery of local
                         services. Access to the grants will be subject to each local authority's meeting minimum mandatory
                         conditions and annual performance targets in various areas of municipal management. The use of the
                         grants will be limited to investments in local roads and associated infrastructure, and all grant
                         amounts would be matched from other local government revenues for a minimum additional 20
                         percent of the grant amount. Capacity building under the component will be provided by a mobile
                         team comprising expertise in key areas of municipal management, finance, planning and community
                         consultation, and procurement and asset development and management. Technical assistance in the
                         areas of environmental and social safeguards will be provided, respectively, by the specialist in
                         procurement and asset development and management, and the specialist in planning and community
                         consultation.

                          Component 3 - Project Management and Technical Assistance

                          Component 3 supports the implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and audit of the Project,
                         including annual Performance Assessments of the participating local governments, provides formal
                         training and short-term technical assistance to local governments and the Government, and provides
                         technical assistance to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and the Ministry of
                         Tinkhundla Administration and Development to strengthen their capacity to support and monitor
                         local government performance. The component includes the costs of the Project Support Team,
                         which will oversee and manage the project on a day-to-day basis, and which will be paid for by the
                         Government of Swaziland.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will be implemented in urban areas, with a focus on local (municipal) road rehabilitation,
                         and in existing settlements in rural areas, where small-scale infrastructure investments are likely to
                         include culverts, small-scale water systems, but and taxiranks, and public market infrastructure.

                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
Public Disclosure Copy




                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                               Potential adverse environmental and social impacts may occur under Components 1 and 2.
                              Component 1 will finance small infrastructure investments, including roads improvements, minor
                              bridges or culverts, bus ranks or local market shelters, and small-scale water and/or sanitation
                              facilities. Component 2 will provide grants to urban local governments to repair and rehabilitate
                              local (municipal) roads. Potential adverse environmental and social impacts might include loss of
                              vegetation, soil and water pollution, soil erosion, and spread of malaria (from standing water) and
                              adverse health impacts on humans and animals due to poor waste management. None of these
                              impacts will be irreversible. Involuntary settlement may occur with respect to some sub-project
                              activities; these could include temporary use of land during construction, or small uses of privately
                              held or used land for the siting of community-selected infrastructure sub-projects.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                               The only indirect and/or long term impact due to sub-project activities envisaged is erosion/land
                              degradation resulting from the construction of culverts in mountain areas.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                               In the course of sub-project selection and detailed design, road section alignments will be
                              reviewed and marketplace locations will be selected to minimize adverse environmental and social


                                                                         Page 3 of 6
                           impacts. Similarly, culverts will be designed to reduce erosion on farmland or other productive
                           assets. Environmental and social protection clauses will be incorporated into the works contracts,
                           including related to HIV/AIDS prevention.

                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                             The borrower prepared (i) an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) dated
                           February 25, 2008; and (ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) dated December 2007.
                           However, the ESMF and RPF do not yet reflect changes in the project design prepared in 2009 and
                           2010. The ESMF and RPF are being revised to reflect the new project design. Note that existing
                           institutional capacity to address safeguards issues is relatively weak, mirroring general weakness
                           in local governance. The project supports capacity building in environmental and social
                           safeguards through technical assistance to local governments and oversight through a dedicated
                           position in the Project Support Team.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                             Key stakeholders consulted during the preparation of the ESMF included responsible ministries,
                           the Swaziland Environment Authority, local Chiefs, the National Emergency Response for HIV/
                           AIDS, and several town boards. Sub-project identification will take place in the context of
                           significant community consultation, and in the case of Component 1 sub-project investments, local
                           community members will a lso be involved in detailed sub-project design and implementation.
                           Sub-project selection and consultation includes the discussion of potential environmental and
                           social impacts and the incorporation of mitigation measures.
