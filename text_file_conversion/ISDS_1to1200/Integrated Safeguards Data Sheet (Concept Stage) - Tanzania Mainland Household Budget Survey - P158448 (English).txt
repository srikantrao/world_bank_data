                           The project development objective is to support the Government of Tanzania in producing quality
                           and cost-effective household survey data for a regular and consistent monitoring of poverty and other
                           socioeconomic statistics.
                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed project activities cover three main parts linked to the: (i) preparation and design, (ii)
                           implementation and data collection, and (iii) analysis and dissemination of the HBS for 2016/17. In
                           preparation for the survey, a clear set of activities have been identified which will strengthen NBS
                           capacity to prepare and implement the survey in a more cost-effective manner through a series of
                           technical assistance engagement.
                           The details of the activities are as follows:
                           1)    Survey preparation and design. This part has three clusters of activities: first, to support NBS in
                           designing the survey questionnaire in such a way that it collects data on new indicators relevant to
                           multiple sectors, aimed at gaining a better understanding of the root causes of poverty as well as a
                           better evaluation of the progress towards the SDGs. Second, to improve the sampling design and
                         increase the survey representativeness. The previous HBS for 2007 and 2011/12 interview a
                         nationally representative sample of over 10,000 households, but the poverty (and other socio-
                         economic) indicators produced by the surveys are representative only at the national and major

                         geographic domains, namely Dar es Salaam, Rural and other Urban areas. Technical assistance will
                         be provided to improve the sampling design and representatively at regional levels, based on costs
                         and data quality considerations. Depending on the budget envelop, the objective would be either to
                         increase the levels of precision for the survey and target representative estimates at the national,
                         major geographic domains and regional levels; or to design the survey with a similar precision to the
                         previous HBS but reduce the sample size significantly. A series of hands-on trainings will be
                         provided to strengthen the sampling capacity in the NBS to develop more efficient sample designs,
                         taking into consideration the impact of the different choices of sample size on the accuracy of survey
                         estimates, data quality and survey costs. Third, review the method of collection of consumption data
                         and the reference period. The previous HBS collect food expenditures using a 28-day diary and
                         non-food expenditures using the dairy as well as recall module and are conducted over 12 months.
                         This requires intensive and frequent supervision and leads to high costs, respondent fatigue etc.
                         Assistance will be provided to NBS in order to review the data collection method and build on best
                         practices for improving the cost effectiveness of the survey, while preserving comparability with
                         previous surveys as much as possible. Maintaining comparability of the surveys may be very
                         challenging and will require a thorough investigation of appropriate methods and techniques to
                         address it at the survey design stage as well as at the data processing and analysis phase.
                         2)       Survey implementation and data collection: the project will support the implementation of
                         the HBS and data collection process. The activities will include the preparation of the training
                         materials and documents for the trainers and interviewers, the selection of the enumerators, and the
                         preparation of the fieldwork calendar and the quality control during the fieldwork.
                         3)       Data processing and dissemination. This component comprises three sets of activities. First,
                         to support NBS in cleaning and compiling the survey data. The activities will include the preparation
                         of a standard approach for data cleaning and quality assurance and the production of a fully
                         documented and replicable procedure for data verification, error checking and correction etc. Second,
                         assist NBS in the poverty (and other key statistics) estimation methodology, including the estimation

                         of the consumption aggregates, price indicators, poverty line etc. A special focus will be devoted to
                         addressing the comparability issues that may arise from the potential changes in the survey design.
                         Third, to assist NBS in the analysis of the survey data, preparation of the HBS report and
                         dissemination of the survey results.

                         The lending instrument will be Investment Project Financing (IPF), financed with a Recipient
                         Executed Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building at the amount of US$ 2,300,000, and will
                         finance consulting services, operating costs, trainings and workshops, and procurement of goods with
                         a maximum of 20 percent of the grant amount. An additional amount of US$ 200,000 will be
                         allocated for technical assistance and will be managed centrally through a Bank-executed Trust Fund.

                         The project costs (in US$) by component are as follows:

                         1.      Survey preparation and design     : 695,350
                         2.      Survey implementation and data collection : 1,189,430
