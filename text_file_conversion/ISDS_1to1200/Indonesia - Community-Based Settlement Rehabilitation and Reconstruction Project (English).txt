A.2. Project Objectives 
The main objective of the project is to support the efforts of the Government of Indonesia (GoI) in restoring 
the living conditions (housing and basic infrastructure) of the communities affected by the devastating 
effects of the earthquake and tsunami that struck NAD and Nias on December 26, 2004 through: 
(i) contribution to the GoI’s grant program for settlement rehabilitation and reconstruction, targeting an 
estimated 200 rural and urban villages affected by the disaster; and, 
(ii) provision of institutional support to the Directorate of Housing, Water and Sanitation (DHWS) under 
the Aceh Reconstruction Agency (BRR-Badan Rekonstruksi dan Rehabilitasi), the lead agency in 
settlement reconstruction for NAD and Nias. 
A.3. Project Description 
The proposed project is based on the approach and methodology of the Urban Poverty 
Project (UPP) and Kecamatan Development Project (KDP), to address disaster recovery, 
rehabilitation and reconstruction through a community-driven development approach in 
NAD-Nias. While maintaining the design features of UPP and KDP community 
empowerment principles, changes have been made to suit the requirements of speedy 
implementation of rehabilitation and reconstruction in urban communities in NAD and 
Nias.  These include additional housing facilitators, and a limited open menu of grants for 
shelter reconstruction and repair, and priority infrastructure reconstruction and repair. 
 
Component A: 
Shelter Repair and Reconstruction Grants 
(US$50 million)
 
This component will provide financing for in-situ rehabilitation and reconstruction of about 200 affected 
rural villages (desa) and urban wards (kelurahan) through GoI’s grants program for settlements 
rehabilitation and reconstruction. Shelter reconstruction and repair grants will be given as two types of 
support based on the GoI’s Masterplan: Rp 10 million for partially damaged or Rp 28.8 million for fully 
Page  2
destroyed houses.  The funding under this component is estimated to provide up to approximately 15,000 
shelter repair grants and up to 10,000 shelter reconstruction grants for new houses. These estimated 
numbers of grants are indicative numbers and can only be finalized once the verification of damage is 
complete at the community level.  This grant aims to cover housing reconstruction and repair costs based 
on a structure of about 36 sq. meters based on the estimates prepared by GoI. Management of these grants 
relies on community-based organizations established through ongoing CDD projects financed by the World 
Bank (Kecamatan Development Project-KDP in rural villages and Urban Poverty Project -UPP in urban 
wards).  Under the guidance of the housing facilitator and DMC teams, attention will be given to ensuring 
hazard-resistant design standards and sound construction practices are adopted by communities during 
reconstruction.  
 
In addition to KDP and UPP which are the main project partners, NGOs and international organizations 
which align with the overall operational framework on housing reconstruction envisaged by GoI and 
operating under similar principles of community participation will be considered for possible inclusion in 
the project based on GoI’s request and in consultation with the communities.  In this case, the project, 
communities and these organizations will enter into partnership agreements.   
 
Possible funding for transitional housing and addressing the needs of internally displaced people (IDP) will 
be considered on case-by-case basis according to the demand from beneficiaries and based on the 
implementation plan proposed in the framework of community settlement plans (CSP).  
 
Component B: 
Block Grants for Priority Infrastructure 
(US$20 million)
 
This component finances block grants for kelurahan or desa for the rehabilitation of small-scale priority 
infrastructure
1
(mainly secondary and tertiary networks) as well as other utilities related to effectiveness of 
the shelter repairs and reconstruction program, according to the rehabilitation and reconstruction plans 
formulated by the communities. This component builds upon and complements existing infrastructure grant 
support provided through the existing KDP and UPP systems for community-level infrastructure 
rehabilitation.  Block grants under this component serves as a matching grant with block grants provided 
through UPP and KDP operations in the same framework of community settlement plans (CSP) to fill 
minimum basic infrastructure and social service needs. The initial block grant amount starts from Rp.500 
million per kelurahan or desa, but given the diverse size of the communities, this is not a one-time grant, 
and if needs for additional funding will be considered in the framework of the agreed Community 
Settlement Plan. Communities whose housing needs are covered by other donors may also apply for 
infrastructure block grants, provided they utilize similar community-based planning mechanisms, 
acceptable to GoI and the World Bank.
 
Component C:
 Project Implementation Support 
(US$11.6 million) 
To expedite the settlement reconstruction and rehabilitation program at the local and national levels, 
implementation support will be critical for mobilizing teams, preparing training programs, and hiring 
consultants. This component will finance a series of immediate and medium-term technical assistance (TA) 
activities for (i) establishment and implementation of the shelter support grants and priority infrastructure 
block grant schemes and financial management systems acceptable to the World Bank; (ii) overall project 
implementation at the national, district, and village levels, including the hiring and training of 150 housing 
facilitators; and (iii) capacity building at the community level to manage project activities (i.e. training of 
communities and local artisan on construction, disaster mitigation planning, and bookkeeping).  
 
Component D: 
Program Support, Monitoring and Evaluation 
(US$3.4 million)
 
This component covers the cost of the establishment and execution of an internal and 
external monitoring and evaluation framework to maximize effectiveness, accountability, 
and transparency during implementation. Such processes also facilitate good governance 
procedures so that leakages of resources are minimal.

Comments:
 The CSRR Project will support a large number of shelter rehabilitation and 
reconstruction grants to settlement groups, and small sub-project investments for priority 
infrastructure in rural and urban areas.  It is expected to provide grants to settlement 
groups for shelter rehabilitation and reconstruction through shelter grants, (the ceiling for 
settlement groups is Rp.300 million or US$30,000 per group), and finance priority 
tertiary small scale infrastructure through priority infrastructure (the ceiling for 
infrastructure activities is Rp. 500 million or US$50,000 per village). The low ceiling for 
individual activities, combined with the types of activities expected to be financed 
(kelurahan road/bridge improvements, tertiary drainage, water supply to individual 
households, garbage collection through handcarts) indicate that none of these investments 
is expected to have any large scale, significant or irreversible impacts. Environmental 
impacts would come mostly from poor site management during the project construction 
activity.  
 
The annex G of the PAD outlines the environmental screening procedures and guidelines 
to ensure to identify, review, and “red-flag” procedures to ensure that problems are 
corrected. Indonesia’s environmental review procedures are generally consistent with the 
Bank’s and will form the framework of CSRRP’s approach to environmental 
management.

–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Safeguards policies under the project will be addressed in the following manner: 
 
ƒ
Shelter and priority community infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction that 
are a priori known to have an adverse impact on the 
environment
 will not be financed 
(e.g. protected areas, logging--see Annex G).  Environmental Guidelines (Annex G) 
have also been developed to address minor environmental issues that may arise.   
ƒ
Subprojects are not expected to require 
involuntary resettlement
 or acquisition of 
significant amounts of land. In the event they do, however, a Land Acquisition and 
Resettlement Policy Framework (Annex G) has been developed in accordance with 
OP4.12 to ensure application of the appropriate safeguard policies.   
ƒ
The highly participatory nature of the project will ensure that communities would be 
able to identify if any proposed sub-project will have an impact on 
cultural property
 
and to ensure that these activities do not adversely affect cultural property. Sub-
project proposals will require the identification of any such activities and require the 
group proposing the sub-project to specify adequate mitigation measures. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
None anticipated 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Communities and TPK/KERAP/KP will choose how they want to use the funds under the kelurahan grants 
based on the Community Settlement Plans (CSP) that they will develop.  Forum Desa/ TPK/ KERAP will 
evaluate proposals for sub-project from community groups based on the CSP. It is not possible to determine 
a
prior when the safeguards policies will be triggered.   
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Housing/UPP/KDP facilitators and other project staff (PMC/DMCs) will be trained in the understanding 
and application of the guidelines and assist in the preparation of sub-project proposals. TPK/KERAP will 
be trained in how to apply the safeguards in their selection process. Communities will be in charge of 
deciding all implementation arrangements, and follow-up on guidelines and approved proposals will be 
monitored by housing/UPP/KDP facilitators and DMCs/PMC. On the environment, an experienced 
environmental consultant will be required to summarize progress, monitor and measure the impact of the 
project on the environment. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders are the TPK/KERAP and the community. The PMC/DMCs will be trained about the 
safeguards and will carry out similar training for the TPK/KERAP. The environmental and social 
guidelines and frameworks will be made available to the public through the Bank's Project Information 
Centers in Jakarta and Washington, and also will be published in the project manuals and be made 
available, by the 
PMC/DMCs
,
to the community organizations/dinases preparing proposals.
In case any sub 
Page  6
project requires involuntary resettlement, a LARAP will be prepared and disclosed to key project 
stakeholders and the general public by the PMC and DMCs to the general public through the TPK and 
KERAP.
