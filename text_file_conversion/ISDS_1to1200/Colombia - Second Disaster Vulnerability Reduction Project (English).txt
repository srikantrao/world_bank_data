B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project aims at reducing Bogotá’s exposure to human and economic losses in case 
of natural disaster through the implementation of risk mitigation activities and of a risk financing 
strategy.  Together with the other phases of the DVRP-APL, the project will improve Colombia’s 
physical and fiscal resilience to disasters.  The project specifically addresses three of the key sub-
goals of the CAS: (a) maintaining macroeconomic fiscal adjustment: overall macroeconomic 
stability will benefit from better risk management in Colombia’s main city; (b) consolidating 
reform of the financial sector: the development of market-based financial risk transfer 
instruments should contribute to a deepening and strengthening of the financial sector, and; (c) 
making private participation work for the poor: Since the poorest portion of society typically 
lives in the most vulnerable areas, the poorest group will benefit directly from disaster risk 
reduction and financing. 
 
The purpose of this second phase under the DVRP-APL is to reduce the vulnerability of the 
Capital District of Bogotá to adverse natural events by strengthening its capacity to manage 
disaster risk and by reducing its exposure to key risks including earthquakes, floods, and 
landslides.  By program completion, physical and financial vulnerability to adverse natural 
events should be measurably reduced in Bogotá.

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
As with the other phases under the APL, this phase will address the five lines of action outlined 
in the National Plan for Disaster Prevention and Management: (a) risk identification; (b) risk 
reduction; (c) institutional development; (d) risk awareness, and; (e) financial coverage of risk.
 
Component A:  Disaster Risk Identification and Monitoring 
This component would involve hazard mapping for key areas, as well as vulnerability and risk 
analysis of key assets, including hospitals and fire fighting stations.  The component also 
includes the development and installation of hazard monitoring systems.  Studies will be 
undertaken for hazard identification (e.g. floods, landslides, earthquakes), for vulnerability 
assessment (e.g. substandard housing and public buildings) and for risk assessment (e.g. 
probability of loss of life if vulnerability is not assessed). 
 
Component B:  Risk Reduction 
The proposed activities under this component would be aimed at reducing existing and possible 
future risks through seismic mitigation (retrofitting of hospitals, fire stations, schools and day 
care centers); landslide mitigation (four schools and about 9,000 families living in areas 
vulnerable to landslides) and; flood mitigation (five schools). 
 
Component C:  Institutional Development 
Component C would finance the provision of technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of 
the Central District of Bogotá in disaster risk management in general.  This will include training 
and institutional strengthening for agencies part of the District Emergency System.  The 
component will also include support to the Project Coordination Unit within the District Ministry 
of Finance. 
 
Component D:  Risk Prevention and Awareness 
The component aims at increasing awareness for risk management needs at various levels of the 
educational system.  The component will finance city-wide campaigns on risk awareness and 
emergency response by the fire department and other agencies.  This will include the provision 
of emergency and risk management training to more than 300 educational institutions, the 
dissemination of information and some practical research on risk management issues.  It will also 
finance the training of about 280 contractors in the retrofitting of houses to meet seismic resistant 
standards and in low-cost options for safe home construction and design.  About 600 builders 
will also be trained in anti-seismic building techniques and basic concepts of building habitable 
dwellings. 
 
Component E:  Financial Coverage of Risk 
This component would support the development of a strategy for the financial coverage of 
disaster risk in the District of Bogotá.  The strategy will help establish a sustainable level of 
investment in risk mitigation; evaluate acceptable level of reserve for the coverage of high 
frequency events (e.g., floods and landslides); and develop a framework for the financing of 
catastrophic risk (e.g. earthquake), including the identification of possible sources of financing in 
case of a major event occurring in Bogotá.  The component will also support studies for the cost-
effective use of insurance as an ex ante risk financing instrument by the district. In addition, it 
Page  3
will support activities for the development of a private earthquake insurance market and 
promoting the use of insurance by private actors. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project will take place in the broader area of
 Bogotá District.  Specific project intervention 
be scattered throughout the city. 
 
E.  Borrower
’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The governments of Colombia and the Municipality of 
Bogotá have extensive experience with 
the Bank Safeguard Policies.  Bogotá’s latest projects, the Urban Services Projects and Urban 
Transport Project, have shown that DAMA (the municipal environmental agency) and municipal 
implementing agencies have the required environmental oversight capacity.  Moreover, the Caja 
de la Vivienda Popular has a very successful history on hazard risk resettlements and already has 
a
framework in place acceptable to the Bank.

The project triggers OP 4.01.  Project activities are not expected to have large, significant or 
irreversible environmental impacts. Most investments are related to component B. These 
activities are aimed at reducing existing and possible future risks through seismic mitigation 
(retrofitting of hospitals, fire stations, schools and day care centers); landslide mitigation (four 
schools and about 9,000 families living in areas vulnerable to landslides) and; flood mitigation 
(five schools). DAMA has agreed to develop environmental guidelines applicable to the type of 
interventions contemplated in the project. EIA for specific, first year, activities would be 
prepared and used to develop draft guidelines. Once the guidelines are tested, updated and agreed 
with key stakeholders DAMA will enact them for general use throughout the city.  
 
Project intervention also triggers OP 4.12, the Resettlement Policy.  An appropriate resettlement 
framework will be prepared for Bank review and clearance.  The resettlement component aims to 
provide safe housing solutions for families living in high hazard risk areas.
