                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           15.      The development objective is to improve financial control, and the quality and timeliness of
                           public financial management information.
                           C. Project Description
                           17.      The project will support the procurement, configuration and implementation of an off-the-
                           shelf financial management system for all budget votes funded through the Government’s
                           Consolidated Fund. In broad terms, it has been agreed that the two sources of funding will be used as
                           follows:
                           a.       Government has confirmed in September 2015 that it will provide the necessary funding for
                           the purchase of hardware and software in the 2016/17 MTEF. This is estimated to be USD5.00
                           million.
                           b.       The EC funding of USD3.64m (EUR3.34m) would be channeled through a “Recipient
                           Executed Trust Fund” at the World Bank, and fund the technical assistance required for – (i) the
                           design and implementation of the new PFM business processes, controls and information and
                           technical architectures; (ii) direct costs associated with the delivery of the technical assistance; and
                         (iii) project management.

                         18.    Component 1: Design and implementation of the new PFM business processes, controls and

                         information and technical architectures (USD2.11m)

                         This activity will provide technical assistance for –

                         a.      Business process mapping, review and reengineering; design of the financial control,
                         accounting and reporting requirements; and determination of system interfaces.
                         b.      Technical architecture review and design, including site locations, networks, server
                         environment, end-user equipment, data storage and back-up facilities
                         c.      Determination of the user base and capacity gap assessment
                         d.      Assessment of change management requirements
                         e.      Procurement and contracting the IFMIS solution components
                         f.      Quality assurance of the set-up, configuration and commissioning of the IFMIS solution
                         g.      Delivery of the business process, accounting, reporting and IFMIS training plans
                         h.      Implementation of the change management plan
                         i.      Set-up of the IFMIS administration functions, including security and business continuity
                         arrangements and procedures
                         j.      Data clean-up and conversion from the TAS to the new IFMIS

                         19.     Directs costs associated with set-up of the Trust Fund and the delivery of the technical
                         assistance (USD1.01m)

                         This activity includes the direct costs associated with the provision of technical assistance, training
                         and change management, as well as the compulsory trust fund set up costs and management fee.

                         20.     Project management (USD0.52m)

                         Project management and administration costs will be covered under this component, including audit
                         fees.

                         21.     Implementation approach

                         In the first instance, the IFMIS will be made available to the Treasury accounting unit at the Office
                         of the Accountant-general, with the immediate objective to establish effective control over
                         expenditure commitments and the completeness and accuracy of the accounting records of line
                         ministries and the Consolidated Fund. At this stage, it would appear that controls over expenditure
                         commitments are ineffective, and that bank reconciliations are not up to date. This creates an
                         untenable situation for budget execution and, given uncertainties in SACU revenues, introduces
                         substantial fiscal risk for the Government. Expenditure data of line ministries will continue to be
                         created in TAS, and interfaced into the new IFMIS at the center. As a second phase, line ministries
                         will then be connected to the IFMIS in a phased manner, determined by budget control priorities, and
                         connectivity and capacity development activities.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
