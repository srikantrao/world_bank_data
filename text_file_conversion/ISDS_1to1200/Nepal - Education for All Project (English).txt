A.2. Project Objectives

The proposed Nepal Education For All Project (NEFAP) will support the Government's EFA (Education
for All) program 2004-2009. The project's overall objective is to improve equitable access to and the
quality of primary education, and build capacity of national and district agencies, and local communities to
plan and manage education delivery. Using the EFA indicators, specific targets are to further increase the
net enrollment rate from 81 percent to 96 percent; increase achievement in grade 5 from 40 to 60 percent,
further decrease the gender and social gaps, and increase literacy of the 15+ age group from 48 to 66
percent. The `broad pillars' on which the strategies rest include: (a) improving service delivery; (b)
promoting social inclusion; and (c) improving governance.

A.3. Project Description

The program addresses three strategic goals: 1) improving access and equity; 2) enhancing quality and
relevance; and 3) improving efficiency and institutional capacity.1 These goals will be approached through
six sub-programs: (1) expanding early childhood education; (2) ensuring access to all; (3) meeting learning
needs of all; (4) reducing female illiteracy; (5) eliminating gender disparity; and (6) improving all aspects
of quality education. The expanded program of block grants to schools (from 10 percent of the EFA budget
in 2003/2004 to 60 percent of the program budget by 2008/2009) will be the principal implementation
modality.

Improving access and equity. Equitable access will be approached through measures to increase both the
demand for education and the supply of services. On the demand side, expanded involvement of
community-based organizations in identifying, and motivating out of school children to enroll, will
strengthen school outreach. Increased literacy for mothers is also expected to have a long-term positive
impact. Scholarship programs targeted to poor girls, dalits and out of school children from disadvantaged
ethnic groups will offset the private costs of schooling for these groups. Expansion of the number of
classrooms and non-formal programs based in schools, will accommodate growing demand. Alternative
classroom designs that are adapted to different geographical conditions, and which provide better lighting
and ventilation will be introduced. In line with the philosophy that no child should be left out of school,
resources for building additional classrooms will also be provided to communities for constructing low-cost

classrooms using local materials, but whose designs are structurally sound. Double shifting will also be
offered as an option to local communities. Literacy programs for adult women, targeted to dalits and ethnic
minorities with lowest literacy rates, will be expanded.

Enhancing quality and relevance. ECD, delivered through community managed centers and through pre-
primary classes, will be expanded. ECD has been shown to improve learning and completion in grade 1;
enhanced completion of grade 1 in turn, will decrease class size in grade 1 (15 percent of grade 1 students
are currently underage), contributing both to the quality of the learning environment and to efficiency.
Teacher education through a ten-month certificate training course is supported by the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) under a Teacher Education Project. Recurrent in-service teacher training will be strengthened
by making it school based. Under the block grants programs, SMCs will increasingly be able to turn to
local expertise for school improvement activities, including teacher training. Improved school facilities
(including water supply and toilets), and newly developed transitional linguistic support on entry for non-
Nepali speaking students, are expected to further improve the quality of learning, retention of children, and
hence school completion rates.

Improving efficiency and institutional capacity. Key to effective program performance is the shift from
centrally managed sub-programs to an expanded School Block Grants Program (SBGP) that will empower
SMCs in improving the performance of all schools. A parallel initiative, assisted through an IDA-financed
Community School Support Project, will transfer 8,000 of the 21,000 primary schools to community
management with block grant financing over the three years of the project.

All schools currently operate bank accounts and receive earmarked grants through District Education
Offices (DEO) for salaries, and NRS 300 per year to each teacher for teaching and learning materials.
Schools transferred to community management currently benefit from expanded block grants. SIP has been
successfully piloted and is ready to be scaled up. Though less than fully efficient, the basic administrative
structure for block grant financing is in place.

The SBGP will be initiated with a new grant to all schools for non-salary recurrent costs, and an additional
set of grants for which schools can be eligible based on performance against established criteria (Annex 4).
Schools will be accredited, on a voluntary basis, at different levels of eligibility by authorized panels of
experts. Depending on the level of accreditation, schools will be eligible to apply for grants for physical
improvements, enhanced student access, capacity building, and quality improvement. The use of block
grants by schools will be audited annually by committees of parents, and the results of these audits will be
publicly disclosed.

The synergies among strategies to increase access, equity, quality and relevance should improve
performance in enrolling and keeping children in school, raising learning achievement, and improving
system efficiency. The SBGP is the linchpin for the delivery of these strategies by providing adequate
funding for locally relevant inputs/incentives for school performance, and for reducing the imposition of
fees that is detrimental to access by poor students.

Comments:
The environmental impacts are anticipated to be small-scale, arising out of construction of small buildings
and associated facilities (such as drinking water supply), albeit spread over the entire country. The impacts
are all local, and relate to the health, hygiene and safety of the school children.

Section II ­ Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01): The environmental issues in this project relate to site location
and planning (natural hazards; sensitive ecological regions; arsenic contamination in the drinking water
supplied in the schools; site drainage); building design and construction (indoor air quality and daylight
factor inside the classrooms, sanitation facilities and waste management, water supply); and maintenance
during the operation period (site cleanliness and hygiene, prevention of enteric infections).

Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12): As with the two preceding Bank-financed projects in support of
primary education in Nepal, no land will be acquired in the NEFA project so OP/BP 4.12 does not apply.

Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20): Increasing literacy and education levels among the IP and other vulnerable
groups (such as poor women and Dalits or former "low castes") is expected to have a positive impact on
these groups. However, to ensure that children from IP communities get equal access to project benefits
requires extra measures since many of these children do not speak Nepali which is the medium of
instruction. To address this the project is supporting the preparation and delivery of a module/curriculum
for home to school language transition through bi-lingual education for non-Nepali speaking children. It is
also providing incentive grants to schools who hire female teachers who speak the local language.

Cultural Property (draft OP 4.11 - OPN 11.03). The possibility of impacting cultural properties is very
small, and will be addressed through chance-find procedures built in the construction contracts.

No large scale, significant and/or irreversible impact is anticipated in this project.

D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area.

In the long-term, supply of potable water in the schools could be an issue, given the deteriorating trend of
water quality in the country, as a whole. No other long-term impact is anticipated.

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant).

D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

OD 4.01: Environmental Assessment: No new land will be acquired for the project, and as such, culturally
sensitive areas or critical natural habitats will not be affected. The GON has completed an assessment of:

*By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties'
claims on the disputed areas

                       Proposed ISDS PAD Format ­ Draft Pre-meeting with ISG - February 26, 2004



(a) the implications of arsenic in water supply, especially in the Terai area, and testing and mitigation
requirements under the project; (b) systems for ensuring and improving sanitation facilities in schools; (c)
appropriate methods for site selection of school buildings, sanitation and water facilities; and (d)
appropriate designs and materials for creating a good learning environment with adequate lighting,
ventilation, and acoustics. The findings of this assessment were used to prepare environmental guidelines
for construction of new schools, as well as additions or rehabilitations of classrooms in the existing schools.

Environmental guidelines prepared by the HMGN include the following: [a] Guidelines for site selection
and planning of school buildings; [b] Guidelines for design of school buildings (day lighting and windows,
use of solar or other renewable energy systems, ventilations within the classrooms, provision of sanitation
and sewage disposal facilities, provision of adequate drainage, provision for solid waste management, and
landscape development); [c] Guidelines for managing environmental issues during construction including
environmental monitoring during construction; and [e] Arrangements, such as regular supervision and
periodic environmental audits to ensure that the environmental issues are mainstreamed in the planning and
implementation of the program.

OP 4.12: Involuntary Resettlement: The Social Assessment team investigated this aspect of the project and
as noted above, determined that there would be no land acquisition or involuntary resettlement in the
NEFAP

OD 4.20: Indigenous People: Based on HMG's Social Assessment (which covered issues of gender and
Dalit exclusion) and the separate Indigenous People's Plan it carried out , a Vulnerable Communities
Development Plan was prepared to ensure that the barriers to primary education faced by girls and children
from Dalit and Janajati /IP communities is addressed in the project. The main elements of the VCDP are
the following: (i) introducing home to school language transition program in areas where there are large
population of indigenous people or linguistic minorities who do not speak Nepali as a mother tongue, (ii)
incentives for recruitment of local bilingual women teachers in primary schools where necessary, (iii)
partnerships between the SMC and local community groups. These groups would sign MOUs through
which the SMC would fund them to carry out social mapping to identify children from indigenous groups
and other vulnerable communities who are out of school, campaigns and incentives to encourage their
enrolment and regular follow up to track their attendance and progress. The local community group would
act as a catalyst to change attitudes towards caste, gender and ethnic exclusion among parents, teachers and
students and to lobby for the SMC membership to better reflect the gender, caste and ethnic profile of the
community. They would also carry out social audits to track the allocation of school incentive grants ­ and
especially to insure that scholarship funds go to the most needy Dalits, girls and indigenous children.

Borrower Capacity: HMGN has implemented a number of Bank and/or donor supported basic and primary
education projects since 1984. The recent basic and Primary Education Program (BPEP II) covered all 75
districts of Nepal, in which the physical facilities in a large number of schools have been improved, with a
cost-sharing arrangement between the GON and the local communities. The current project builds on these
experiences. HMGN has demonstrated institutional capacity to manage the program, including planning
and implementation of actions to meet social and environmental needs and safeguards.

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Community consultation is an integral part of the overall program. The local communities and institutions
are involved in identification, planning, design, implementation, operation and maintenance of the schools
and all other program activities. Consultations with schoolteachers, experts, NGOs and other stakeholders
will continue throughout the implementation period. Beyond consultations, a key strategy of NEFAP has
been to encourage SMCs to engage local community groups to actually lead the process of involving the
entire community in the school catchment area in a campaign to stop discriminatory practices and to be
proactive about including girls, Dalats and Janajati children in school and to conduct a social audit of the
SMC expenditures including the special grants received for scholarships for girls and Dalit children.

During the review of current school construction activities, as part of the EA, consultations were held with
schoolteachers and CBOs/NGOs. Meetings were held with several stakeholders including the experts from
the department of environment. The draft environmental guidelines were discussed with experts and NGOs,
and the comments have been incorporated in the EA. HMGN will disclose the EA and other documents in
their website, and will also place the reports in public places for wider dissemination project documents.
