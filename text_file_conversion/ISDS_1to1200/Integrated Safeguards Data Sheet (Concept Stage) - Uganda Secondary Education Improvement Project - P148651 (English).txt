                           B. Project Objectives
                           The PDO is to improve access to quality lower secondary education in underserved areas and
                           enhancing the capacity of schools and teachers to deliver the new curriculum.
                           C. Project Description
                           This is a follow on operation to the first Uganda Post-Primary Education and Training (UPPET) APL
                           approved in 2009 and closed at the end of June 2014. The development objectives of UPPET 1 were
                         to: (a) improve access to post-primary education, (b) improve the quality of post-primary education
                         and training; and (c) improve efficiency in the delivery of post- primary education. The second phase
                         will build and expand on the successes of the first phase and focus on (i) strengthening public private

                         partnerships to improve access to and quality in Universal Secondary Education (USE) provision; (ii)
                         enhancing teacher effectiveness including improving teacher competencies, improved accountability
                         and motivation at the post-primary level; and (iii) strengthening math and science education at the
                         post primary level.
                         .
                         C. Project Description
                         Component 1. Increase access to quality lower secondary education in underserved areas
                         (i) Increase access with equity -
                         The objective is to expand access to secondary education in underserved areas (those with lowest
                         Gross Enrollment Rates and high poverty rates ), by expanding the lower secondary school network
                         and providing scholarships for students from low income families, especially girls. The focus would
                         be on expansion of the capacity of existing schools where appropriate and the development of new
                         schools. As a first step, the MoESTS will undertake a rapid mapping and basic data collection (one-
                         page questionnaire) of all existing public and private secondary schools (see component 3.1). Based
                         on this mapping, the MoESTS will establish a school construction strategy for the expansion of
                         existing schools and development of new schools. School construction will be implemented through
                         a results-based financing modality (RBF). A total of approximately 150 new and existing schools
                         (public USE schools) will be supported under this sub-component, though the final number will be
                         determined during preparation.

                         Other Project Components include: Component 2. Support Implementation of Revised Curriculum
                         which will involve among others National roll-out of lower secondary Curriculum, Assessment and
                         Examination Reform Program (CURASSE); Component 3. Strengthening Accountability for Results
                         which will support the implementation of the rapid education management information system
                         (EMIS) and overall project management.

                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The project shall be implemented throughout Uganda. Project Component 1. Increase access to
                         quality lower secondary education in underserved areas - which involves construction of school
                         classrooms, teachersâ€™ houses, sanitation facilities, and installation of rain water harvesting facilities,
                         is the major component which has salient physical characteristics relevant to safeguards analysis. The
                         associated civil works may generate environmental and social impacts, including health and safety
                         issues, mostly during construction phase.

                         Since the project targets expansion of access to secondary education in underserved districts,
                         focusing on improving existing secondary schools and supporting new schools, there are potential
                         aspects of land acquisition and/or involuntary resettlement or displacement of land-uses/livelihoods.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The Ministry of Education and Science Technology and Sports (MoESTS) is currently implementing
                         IDA financed projects and are thus aware of its safeguards policies. However, the Ministry lacks in-
                         house safeguards human capacity that may be required to implement the safeguard policies, and this
                         will require strengthening.
