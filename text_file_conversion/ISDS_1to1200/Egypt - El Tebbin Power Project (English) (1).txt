B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The project development objective is to assist the Government in reaching its goal of providing 
the country with energy supply, at least cost and in a sustainable manner, through investment in 
new generation capacity and support for improved sector performance. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project is a 650 MW power plant comprising of two 325 MW steam turbines using 
natural gas as the main fuel and fuel oil as the back-up fuel.  The total project costs have been 
estimated at about US$350 million, of which the Bank has been requested to finance US$250 
million.  The plant would be built on an existing site that covers an area of 100,000 m
2
,
200
meters from the Nile River.  The existing plant comprises of three 15 MW steam units operating 
on mazout and two 23 MW gas turbine units operating on natural gas.  The units date back to 
1958 and 1979, respectively and the existing plant is expected to be decommissioned, and the site 
will be cleaned and prepared for the proposed project.   A decommissioning plan will be prepared 
and will determine how assets will be disposed.  Preparations of the proposed project are quite 
well advanced.  A draft feasibility study has been prepared on which the Bank has provided 
Page  2
detailed comments, a preliminary environmental assessment has been drafted as have 
comprehensive terms of reference (TORs) for a full blown environmental and social impact 
assessment.  As stated above, land is available, the gas pipeline already reaches the site, and 
power can be evacuated to the transmission network.  However, upgrading of the gas pipeline and 
the transmission network will be required to accommodate the larger power production plant.  
Make up and cooling water for the plant will be drawn from the Nile. 
The preliminary project components are:  (i) demolition of existing plant and site preparation 
works to accommodate the new power plant, including the decommissioning of the existing plant 
and removal from site of existing equipment and debris resulting from demolishing of existing 
buildings; (ii) engineering services to include design, procurement and construction management 
services; (iii) environmental monitoring equipment; (iv) water intake and discharge structure to 
include pump house building, pumps and mechanical and electrical equipment; (v) new power 
plant (power house) to include 2 X 325 MW steam turbines, 2 steam generators and auxiliary 
boiler, 2 transformers and auxiliary transformer, water treatment plant, stack, instruments and 
panel controls, switchgear, civil works, critical piping, mechanical and electrical equipment, 
switchyard, yard tanks; and (vi) interconnection to the national power grid.  In addition, a 
technical assistance component is envisaged that will aim at improved sector performance.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project location is at the site of the existing El-Tebbin power plant about 40 km south of 
Cairo.  The site is situated on about 100,000 m2 wedge-shaped piece of land located in a high 
density industrial and residential area.  On the west side of the site is a 4-lane highway and 
across this highway is the River Nile.    
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The Borrower has been financing power projects with international financing institutions for 
several years and is thus quite experienced with the Bank’s safeguard polices.  In addition, Egypt 
has itself strict environmental regulations on EIAs in conjunction with large infrastructure 
projects and each EIA undertaken needs formal approval by the Egyptian Environmental Affairs 
Agency (EEAA).

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared.   
June, 2005 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
The EIA TORs are currently under review by the Bank.  An independent EIA firm will be 
hired by the implementing agency within 3 weeks or so.  The EIA is expected to be 
completed in June, 2005.
