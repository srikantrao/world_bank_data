3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
        The World Bank                                                                               RESTRUCTURING ISDS
        Nicaragua Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project (P149895)



To achieve the PDO, the Project aims at facilitating access of participating countries to regional risk insurance through
membership in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility Segregated Portfolio Company (CCRIF SPC), by
financing the entrance fee and annual insurance premiums for Nicaragua. The Project finances two Components:

Component 1: Payment of the entrance fee to the CCRIF for Nicaragua (US$1 million)
The objective of this Component is to assist Nicaragua in joining the CCRIF by financing its entrance fee (this fee is
equivalent to the country’s insurance premium).

Component 2: Payment of annual insurance premium to the CCRIF for Nicaragua (US$11 million)
The objective of this Component is to assist Nicaragua in purchasing the catastrophe insurance coverage offered by the
CCRIF during the initial six years of its membership. The insurance covers geophysical events (including but not limited to
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and landslides), and climate-related events (including but not limited to tropical
cyclones and excess rainfall). Every year, Nicaragua will have the choice of selecting the amount of insurance coverage
per type of risk, depending on country risk profile and priority needs.

4. PROJECT LOCATION AND SALIENT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS RELEVANT TO THE SAFEGUARD ANALYSIS (IF
   KNOWN)
The Project will finance entrance fees and annual insurance payments to CCRIF SPC for Nicaragua, with no
direct physical investments. Insurance funds will not be tied or tracked to any specific investments, and the
Project does not trigger any safeguards policies.
