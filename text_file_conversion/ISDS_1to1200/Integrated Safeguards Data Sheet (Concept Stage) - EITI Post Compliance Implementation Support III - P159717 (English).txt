                           The overarching development objective is to improve transparency and accountability in Zambia’s
                           extractive sector by supporting the EITI Zambia Secretariat and the Zambia EITI Council to
                           successfully implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Zambia.
                           C. Project Description
                           Zambia now has a strong track record in producing timely reconciliation reports. So far the
                           information gained from these reconciliation reports has not been used in informing and shaping the
                           policy dialogue in Zambia's mining sector. ZEITI is trying to move beyond the production and
                           dissemination of reconciliation reports to become a more active proponent of transparency and
                           accountability in the sector. The strategic plan that is currently being finalized elaborates further on
                           this.

                           Regarding the new 2016 EITI standard, Zambia has already made significant progress in publishing
                           information on beneficial ownership in its EITI reconciliation reports. The EITI Secretariat has also
                           developed expertise in collecting the data used in the reconciliation reports, which might provide an
                           entry-point for "mainstreaming transparency" in government systems rather than reproducing the

                           data in EITI reporting down the road. Funding for EITI implementation from the GRZ has increased
                           over time and the proposed 2-year US$350,000 grant will provide financing for a smaller portion of
                           the EITI work plan for the next two years.

                           The proposed grant aims to support ZEITI in these efforts. In addition to financing the production of
                           the next two reconciliation reports, which are needed to keep the momentum of EITI in Zambia, the
                           grant foresees financing more innovative and impact-oriented dissemination methods (including the
                           results of the Mining Investment and Governance Review (MInGov) conducted in Zambia) and a
                           mid-year topical report (in mid-2017) that will support ZEITI's new role.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project provides funding for the continued implementation of EITI in Zambia. It aims to enhance
                           transparency and accountability in the mining sector. There are no physical investments planned and
                           the grant will not finance any site specific interventions. Outreach and dissemination activities will
                           take place in Lusaka and mining regions with a broad range of stakeholders, including communities,
                           civil society and community based organizations, and mining companies.

                           The project does not require specific measures on safeguards.
