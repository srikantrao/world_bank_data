A.2. Project Objectives
The direct project development objectives will be to expand the level of activity of 
processing, marketing, and trade enterprises downstream of the farmgate, to increase the 
number and economic importanc
e of producer organizations, and to improve the 
functioning of markets and  trade linkages between producers, and primary and 
secondary level trade organizations.  The Project will work directly with private 
enterprises and producer and other commercial or
ganizations to improve the 
competitiveness of Kyrgyz products.  It is important that the Project be responsive to the 
needs of the private sector in achieving this goal.  Best practice from around the world 
shows that there needs to be an integrated effort
 along the supply chains in question if 
real results are to be achieved.  If project interventions are not targeted in this manner, the 
chances of achieving the ultimate objective of increased sales will decline. 
The ultimate objective of these efforts w
ill be to increase the amount of value added to 
Kyrgyz agro
-
food commodities, to increase sales of those commodities both domestically 
and abroad, and to improve the operation of domestic agricultural markets.
Key outcome indicators for the Project will b
e:

 
Increased share of agricultural production being processed

 
Increased role of producer organizations in agricultural marketing

 
The repayment performance of loans extended (repayment rate, etc)

The number of PFIs participating in the Project
The Country Assistance Strategy, approved on May 15, 2003, focuses on three key 
priorities, each corresponding to a priority focus of the National Poverty Reductio
n 
Strategy (NPRS).     The Project will directly address the number one priority identified 
in the CAS, namely promoting private sector
-
led growth.  The CAS identifies three key 
drivers of economic growth for Kyrgyzstan 
--
 agriculture and agro
-
processing, 
industry 
and energy, and small and micro enterprises.  The Project will be a key element in 
addressing these.  At the time of the CAS presentation, the Project was included with a 
new irrigation project under the title "Agriculture Modernization and Market
ing Project".  
Subsequently, the Country Unit took the decision to split the project in two, allowing the 
processing of the Agribusiness and Marketing Project to move ahead separately and to 
simplify project design and implementation arrangements.
A.
3. Project Description
The Project will work with commodities for which viable import substitution, export 
development opportunities, or inefficient functioning of domestic markets has been 
identified.  This information will be generated through direct in
teraction with enterprises 
and organizations involved in those supply chains.  The approach of the Project will be to 
work with those business opportunities that are relatively closer to achieving higher sales 
of commodities or improved market functioning,
 rather than to take on higher
-
risk areas 
where a greater number of issues would need to be addressed.  Working directly with 
private sector organizations involved in commodity supply chains will ensure that 
interventions included in the Project are target
ed to real business needs rather than to 
assumptions of what those business needs might be.  
Component 1:  Market Development Component ($6.65 million of which PHRD 
Cofinancing Grant $4.05 million and IDA Credit $2.6 million)
The Market Development Compo
nent is designed to address constraints to improved 
functioning of commodity supply chains through interventions in both the private and 
public sectors.  The focus of this component will be on building business capacity of the 
Page  3
parties involved in marketing
 chains of agricultural commodities and providing them the 
foundation to work together more effectively.  
The sub
-
components are:  (i) Supply Chain Management ($4.5 million of which PHRD 
Cofinancing Grant $3.95 million and IDA Credit $0.55 million); (ii)
 Export Promotion 
($1.05 million, all IDA Credit); (iii) Public Sector Investment Program ($1.0 million, all 
IDA Credit); and (iv) Public Sector Capacity Building ($0.10 million, of which PHRD 
Cofinancing Grant $0.10 million).  
Supply Chain Management Su
b-
Component
The goal of this sub
-
component is to directly support institutional and overall capacity 
building among private sector actors involved in the marketing of Kyrgyz agricultural 
and food commodities.  An Agribusiness Competitiveness Center (ABCC)
–
 with strong 
business and language skills 
–
 will be established by the Project to manage the work 
under the Market Development Component.  This will be modeled on the basis of similar 
private sector development organizations set up in Georgia, Moldova, 
and Slovenia.  The 
ABCC will engage directly with the following types of private sector clients: producer 
organizations, processing enterprises and traders.  The ABCC will serve as both a 
channel for providing technical assistance to these clients and for 
collecting feedback 
from the private sector concerning limitations on competitiveness and efficiency that 
would entail changes in the policy and regulatory environment and/or investment in 
public sector infrastructure.  
The ABCC will need to be a fair an
d objective player in dealing with marketing chain 
issues, have top level business and professional skills, and be free from political 
interference in its work.  
Agreement on criteria for selection of staff of the ABCC will be 
reached during appraisal.  Is
suing of a Government resolution legally establishing the 
ABCC will be a condition of negotiations.  
Legal analysis of the appropriate form for the 
ABCC has been carried out.  The ABCC will be established as an entity (uchrezhdenie) 
with the Government as 
its founder.  A Supervisory Board consisting of the MAWRPI, 
the Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Trade, and the Ministry of Finance, and 
representatives of the private sector and donors will be established to oversee the work of 
the ABCC.  
The ABCC wil
l provide business and technical advice to private sector clients through 
contracting with international business consulting firms and teaming these with local 
consultants to be hired on a per
-
contract basis.  The business and technical services will 
be pr
ovided on a matching grant basis, with the clients obligated to contribute toward 
partial covering of these costs.  Based on experience in comparable interventions 
elsewhere in the region, the client co
-
financing shares are expected to be 20 percent or 
les
s.  
Agreement on the minimum cofinancing shares for clients will be reached during 
appraisal.
  Because of the relatively high share of grant financing, the lessons learned 
through the work with the private sector clients will be available to others as a pu
blic 
good.  
Page  4
Within the ABCC capability needs to be established to handle market development and 
trade promotion in the Kyrgyz Republic in a pro
-
active and results oriented approach.  
The approach taken heretofore in the Kyrgyz Republic has been primarily
 reactive in that 
markets have to be found for what has been produced, without sufficient feedback from 
the markets themselves about the appropriate product profile.  
It has been identified that 
both agro
-
processors and primary producers are currently suff
ering from a severe lack of 
market information and have also not been successful in developing trade contacts and 
trading links with consumers of their goods. For these reasons, a 
Market Development 
Service
 (MDS) will be established within the ABCC.  The f
unctions and structure of the 
MDS are described in Annex  4.  
The strategy behind establishing the ABCC is to create skills and capacity within 
Kyrgyzstan to collaborate effectively with foreign TA providers and to take over 
leadership of technical assis
tance functions in the area of business development by the 
end of the Project.  To support this objective, a program of capacity building for the 
ABCC will be undertaken with focus in the first two years of Project implementation.  
This will consist of a p
rogram of foreign training at relevant models both within the CIS 
and in the West.  There will be a program of training and assistance internally for ABCC 
staff carried out by consultants from other countries in the CIS that have developed skills 
under rel
ated enterprise development projects, as well as by closely
-
focused international 
TA.
Once the ABCC is well
-
established, a program of technical assistance for processing and 
trading enterprises, as well as for producer organizations and marketing cooperat
ives, 
will be provided.  The scope and depth of the interventions will differ depending on the 
nature and needs of the clients.  After an initial review of prospective clients, TA 
packages will be defined and bid competitively.  There will need to be flexi
bility in the 
number and type of clients in each package, and the phasing of the packages.  The Project 
will be working actively with other donors and relying on analysis done during 
preparation of the Project by the team from AFC to identify potential cli
ents for 
participation.  For producers organizations and marketing cooperatives, the ABMP will 
rely on the work of other donors active in this area, most notably the GTZ, and on the 
Village Investment Project to identify potential clients of this type.  Th
e first package will 
be critical for establishing the credibility of the ABCC and the Project and will be given 
particular attention.  (A description of the phasing of this work is provided in Annex 6).  
It will be important that the first package includes
 a representative cross
-
sample of 
private sector clients and that there is diversity in the commodity composition.  On the 
basis of the experience from the first package, subsequent packages will be put together 
and tendered. 
The ABCC will have the role 
not only of working with individual private sector clients, 
but of serving as mediator and forum for bringing together agents in the marketing chains 
of agricultural and food commodities to address overriding efficiency and 
competitiveness issues, to commu
nicate more effectively, and to identify opportunities 
for ‘win
-
win’ business collaboration.  The ABCC will work to identify opportunities for 
supply chain integration for specific commodities and to structure subsequent TA 
Page  5
packages to incorporate this.  T
hrough its work with the private sector, the ABCC will be 
responsible for identifying marketing inefficiencies that can and should be addressed 
either through policy and regulatory reform or through investment in public or mixed 
public
-
private infrastructu
re.
For this sub
-
component, the PHRD Cofinancing Grant will finance the costs of 
consultant services.  The IDA Credit will finance the operating and equipment costs of 
the ABCC, as well as a program of foreign training for local consultants and ABCC staff
.
Export Promotion Sub
-
Component
The export link is sufficiently critical for the Project that targeted interventions in this 
area, in addition to the efforts of the ABCC, may be required.  For this reason the Project 
would hire a trade linkage contracto
r (TLC) with the purpose of reinforcing the efforts of 
the ABCC to link domestic sellers of Kyrgyz agricultural and food commodities with 
foreign buyers.  The TLC will have demonstrated success in the promotion of agricultural 
and food commodity exports, p
referably in the ECA region, and will have incentives built 
into their contract to link their payments to actual increases in exports. 
The TLC will be responsible for identification of specific barriers to increased sales of 
Kyrgyz commodities at specif
ic markets, in particular inconsistencies in grades and 
standards, packaging and presentation, volume and quality consistency.  The TLC will 
provide this information to the ABCC.  One option is to target Russian firms for this 
assignment, given that:  (i) 
this will be the most important export market; (ii) the Russian 
food processing industry is developing strongly with growing trade expertise; and (iii) 
there are advantages to interaction without a language barrier and having a shared socio
-
cultural link t
hrough their shared status as ex
-
Soviet republics.
All costs under this sub
-
component are to be financed by the IDA Credit.
Public Sector Investment Program
Significant infrastructure and technology weaknesses are likely to be encountered in the 
supply 
chain work under this Component.  For private sector investment requirements, 
the Access to Credit Component (see below) will be available to address those needs.  
For public sector investment requirements, funds will need to be set aside.  These may 
inclu
de market information systems, grading and standards, and municipally
-
owned 
marketing infrastructure.  There may be cases of mixed public
-
private infrastructure, 
where a push from the public sector is necessary to overcome existing hurdles to 
development. 
 The Project will be able to address these constraints as well on the 
condition that control arrangements for these infrastructural elements adequately reflect 
their private sector content.  Any proposals for public sector or mixed public
-
private 
infrastru
cture investment will have to be generated from the work with private sector 
clients and be tied to real business needs as demonstrated in the supply chain work.  This 
is consistent with the demand
-
driven orientation of the Project and the need for well
-
ta
rgeted interventions.

All costs under this sub
-
component are to be financed by the IDA Credit.
Public Sector Capacity Building
The Supervisory Board of the ABCC will serve as the vehicle for bringing together 
stakeholders in the Project.  The Board, in 
addition to its members  
–
  the MAWRPI, the 
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Chamber of 
Commerce and two other privated sector representatives 
–
 will allow for participation of 
non
-
member representatives in its meetings
 and an ‘open house’ framework for airing 
views and issues of concern to the  Project.  The Supervisory Board will play an 
important role in addressing a number of public sector issues under the Market 
Development Component.  These are:  (a) strengthening 
of the public sector’s ability to 
carry out functions appropriate for a market system, and to build appropriate public
-
private linkages in the agro
-
food sector of the economy; and, (b) raising for consideration 
by Government identified policy and regulator
y constraints to improved competitiveness 
of Kyrgyz commodities that are identified by the ABCC and by other Board 
representatives.  Under point (a) the following activities are foreseen:  (i) workshops and 
short training sessions for Government staff on t
he strategy of the Project and status of its 
implementation; (ii) appropriate models for public
-
private partnerships; and (iii) other 
topics relevant to efficient market operation, such as roles for the private sector in price 
risk management.  Activities 
foreseen under point (b) include:  (i) reconciliation of 
existing grades and standards to international standards for identified export markets; (ii) 
legal facilitation of commodity
-
based financing mechanisms; (iii) improvement in VAT 
administration and pr
actices; and (iv) improvement in customs procedures, and others.
The costs of this sub
-
component are to be financed by the PHRD Cofinancing Grant.
Component 2: Access to Credit Component ($5.9 million, of which PHRD Cofinancing 
Grant $0.6 million and IDA
 Credit $5.3 million)
The objectives of the Access to Credit Component are to:  (a) address key constraints 
associated with access to capital by enterprises in the agricultural and food sector of the 
economy, and (b) expand lending to agricultural and food
 processing sector by the formal 
banking sector through introduction of risk mitigating tools for commercial banks. 
The Component will be implemented through eligible commercial banks and other 
financial institutions. The Participating Financial Institut
ions (PFIs), selected on the basis 
of specific eligibility criteria, will sign a Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) with the 
MOF.  After the initial training and technical assistance provided by the project, the PFIs 
will be responsible for identifying prospe
ctive sub
-
borrowers, and have full autonomy in 
sub
-
project approval.  Detailed eligibility criteria for sub
-
borrowers, and terms and 
conditions for borrowing the proceeds of the Credit Facilities and on
-
lending to the final 
beneficiaries are specified in t
he Lending Guidelines. 
The Component is designed as a combination of capacity building in the participating 
financial institutions, and a credit line for investment and working capital loans, to help 
Page  7
the commercial banks to mitigate the risks involved in
 lending to agriculture.  The 
component will encourage the banks to expand their rural lending activities, as, except 
for some of the larger food processors in Kyrgyzstan, enterprises in the agricultural sector 
are currently not able to access credit from 
financial institutions. 
The Component will be composed of the following parts:  (i) Technical Assistance to the 
commercial banking sector, including PFIs (US$ 0.66 million, of which PHRD 
Cofinancing Grant US$ 0.5 million); (ii) Investment Credit Facility
 (US$4.0 million, all 
financed from the IDA Credit); (iii) Structured Finance Facility (US$1.0 million, all 
financed from the IDA Credit); and (iv) Credit Line Management Unit (US$0.265 
million, of which $0.105 million financed from the PHRD Cofinancing Gr
ant).
Technical Assistance to the Commercial Banking Sector, including Participating 
Financial Institutions (US$ 0.66 million, of which US$0.5 million financed from the 
PHRD Co
-
financing Grant and US$0.16 million financed from the IDA Credit)
The proje
ct will undertake capacity building of the PFIs, to help them deal with entering 
the relatively new markets of lending to agricultural and rural sectors.  After participation 
in the training, qualified participating financial institutions will have access 
to a credit 
facility, for lending for viable business activities.  The training will be provided on two 
subjects:

 
Investment lending
.  The training will be designed to address the limited 
knowledge and skills in the banking sector as to appraisal and risk
 management of 
long
-
term investment lending, especially with respect to agriculture.  The training 
will include specifics of agricultural lending (such as seasonality of agricultural 
production, impact of external factors, introduction to agricultural tech
nologies, 
etc); appraisal of financial and operational sustainability of long
-
term investment 
proposals, including commercialization opportunities; identification and 
mitigation of risks in investment lending; and loan pricing methodologies. 

 
Risk mitigat
ion tools for lending to agricultural production and processing.
  The 
training will focus on teaching loan officers in the participating financial 
institutions to identify risks involved in lending to agricultural production and 
processing, and introductio
n of selected risk mitigation tools, such as: 
(i)
the use of price risk mechanisms, such as contractual farming 
arrangements, and warehouse
-
backed working capital financing 
(marketing efficiency improvements) by those involved in agro
-
food 
supply chains and t
he role of banks in the operation of those 
mechanisms; and 
(ii)
the use of transaction finance, such as warehouse receipts and other 
commodity
-
based financing mechanisms as a means of risk reduction 
and expanding the collateral base. 
Investment Credit F
acility (US$4.0 million, all financed from the IDA Credit)
Page  8
This sub
-
component will provide access to investment capital for the emerging producer 
organizations and private businesses in any legal form, involved in processing and 
marketing of agricultural 
commodities, which will also allow the PFIs to apply the 
improved knowledge in appraisal of such investment proposals.
Eligible investments will include a wide range of agriculture
-
related activities, such as 
investments in development of storage, grading
, packing and marketing of agricultural 
produce, investments in processing facilities and domestic marketing and export of 
agricultural products.  Proceeds of the IDA funds will be on
-
lent through Participating 
Financial Institutions (PFIs)  
-
 commercial b
anks and KAFC, which be selected on the 
basis of specific eligibility criteria, and will be responsible for identifying prospective 
sub
-
borrowers. 
Structured Finance Facility (US$1.0 million, all financed from the IDA Credit)
This sub
-
component will be 
the “learning” part of the credit line, and will test innovative 
financing schemes for Kyrgyzstan, through:  (a) facilitating establishment of contractual 
arrangements throughout agricultural value chains, in particular, between producer 
organizations, agr
o-
processing companies and marketing companies, and (b) introducing 
banks to transaction finance, such as warehouse
-
backed risk mitigation tools. 
The structured finance sub
-
component will have two main products.  The 
first product
will be transaction fin
ance working capital loans to agro
-
processing companies, involving 
managed warehouses and insurance of goods
 as risk management tools for the 
participating financial institutions.  An option of using warehouses as price risk 
management tool to finance work
ing capital loans for improvement of marketing 
efficiency, both for agro
-
processors and producer organizations, will also be considered.
In principle, such transaction financing is very relevant for commodity companies 
without  track records, as it allows
 the lenders to reduce the risk profile of the transaction 
they are financing, as well as allows to expand the borrower’s collateral base.  The credit 
enhancement provided by structured finance lies in the fact that banks have greater 
control over the comm
odity and financing flows.  The traditional balance
-
sheet lending 
requires knowing the real value of the balance sheet, while in structured finance deals 
much less emphasis is placed on the value of the balance sheet, enabling banks to isolate 
the financin
g of sound transactions from the overall accounts of the company.  It is 
expected that the training and piloting of deals with the PFIs will work as a catalyst for 
future development of structured finance in Kyrgyzstan.
The 
second product
 will provide sea
sonal working capital loans to allow pre
-
financing 
agricultural production in contractual farming schemes, financing of marketing contracts, 
and other similar types of contractual arrangements with agro
-
producers.  A precondition 
for beneficiaries under th
is sub
-
component will be a signed / preliminary agreed forward 
contract.  The maximum loan amount will be US$ 200,000 equivalent (aggregate of sub
-
loans A and B). 
Page  9
Credit Line Management Unit (US$0.265 million, of which $0.105 million financed 
from the PH
RD Cofinancing Grant and  US$0.16 million financed from the IDA 
Credit)
A separate management unit 
-
 Credit Line Management Unit (CLMU) 
-
 will be used for 
implementation of this component.  The Component will use the PMU of the Second 
Rural Finance Project
 (RFP II), as during its operation, the PMU has developed the 
necessary capacity and specific skills to administer implementation of all aspects of  
credit lines.  The PMU has been staffed and supplied with the necessary equipment and 
software, and fully e
quipped to assume management of the credit line component, liaising 
with the commercial banking sector, financial management, disbursement, and other day
-
to
-
day administrative tasks. (For more details on the implementation arrangements please 
see Annex 4.)
Component 3 :  Project Monitoring and Advisory Office ($0.15 million, of which $0.11 
million financed from the PHRD Cofinancing Grant and $0.04 million from the IDA 
Credit)
A  Project Monitoring and Advisory Office (PMAO) will be established in the MAWR
PI 
on the basis of the existing Project Preparation Unit.  Its functions will include overall 
monitoring of the Project and management of the public
-
sector capacity building 
activities included in the Project.  As part of its monitoring functions, the PMAO
 will 
carry out environmental monitoring for the Project as specified in the ABMP 
Environmental Impact Assessment.  The PMAO would be responsible for identifying 
issues related to implementation of the Project that might require attention and possible 
foll
ow up action by Government and/or IDA.  The PMAO will also be responsible for 
summary reporting on the Project, based on reports provided by the ABCC and the 
CLMU, and other sources.  The PMAO would have a staff of three, with a Director, 
Project Monitorin
g Officer, and Office Assistant.

D.1. Describe any saf
eguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
As it was agreed at the PCN Review Meeting, no safeguard measures are triggered by the 
Project.  N
o l
and expropriation is expected in any of the physical investments for which 
funds may be borrowed by enterprises under the Credit component. Land transactions, if 
any, will be private, on a willing
-
seller willing
-
buyer basis.  Under the Public 
Infrastructur
e sub
-
component, there will be no new construction requiring acquisition of 
land through eminent domain, and will be limited to rehabilitating existing structures, if 
any.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated fu
ture 
activities in the project area.
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives 
(if relevant)
