Is this project processed under OP 8.50 (Emergency 
recovery)? 
Yes?

Environmental Category: B 
Safeguard Classification:  S2 
A.2. Project Objectives 
 
 
The overall objective of the MOH Five Year Plan which this operation will support is to 
improve the health status of the population while reducing inequities. 
 
 
In addition, the following indicators will be monitored to ensure that institutional objectives 
are met: 
 
• 
% of government allocation to health centers which reach the health center 
• 
% of new financial management functions which the DAAF is able to carry out 
each year 
• 
% of increased coverage achieved through contracting Municipalities, Rural 
Development Committees (CRDs) and private service providers 
• 
% of indicators to graduate to budget support completed. 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Although a budgetary support approach is being considered for Guinea in the years to 
come, the conditions are not yet met.  Consequently the proposed project will follow a relatively 
classic investment approach while taking care to coordinate its activities, indicators, and results 
with other donors in the health sector.  Project management will remain within the Ministry of 
Health, albeit with added support systems as needed.  Considering the governance and equity 
problems which Guinea faces, its human resources cannot continue to be scattered through 
various projects dealing with donors in a dispersed manner. 
 
The IDA credit will focus its activities in three areas in which it has comparative 
advanta

care services: medical provisions and drugs, provision of materials to improve the medical 
referral system (radios and ambulances), materials to strengthen an existing health mutual system,  
resources to reinvigorate community health committees; (ii) for institutional strengthening: 
support to the central accounting agency, monitoring and evaluation, and expenditures tracking; 
and (iii) for  improving human resources:  support for training more midwives, ensuring on-the-
job training, and developing a system of recruiting retired midwives. 
 
No construction or rehabilitation are included in these activities.  Any social funds aspect 
of the project would include a negative list on which would figure civil works.
 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
           Project activities will take place at health facilities (hospitals, clinics, centers) throughout the 
country, with particular attention to those serving the poorest populations.  No particular region will be 
targeted, and both urban and rural zones will be covered.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.   
 
No civil works will be undertaken under the proposed project, and no significant impacts 
are expected.  The project may assist hospitals to develop waste management policies, 
but a plan has already been approved, submitted to the Safeguards Unit, and disclosed (at 
the time of the HIV/AIDS project preparation in 6/2000).  It has been 
re-disclosed
 in 
relation to this project as well to satisfy Bank requirements under the environmental 
assessment policy (OP 4.01) 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area:   
 
    None are anticipated 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
None needed. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The borrower has begun implementing the medical waste management plan in certain 
hospitals.  There have been conflicting proposals regarding incinerators which have 
slowed progress over the last twelve months, but the importance of respecting waste 
management measures is clear, and monitoring and evaluation of the plan is in place. 
 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
No consultation and disclosure is considered necessary for this project since the only 
safeguards policy document is the waste management plan that was previously disclosed 
and implemented.
