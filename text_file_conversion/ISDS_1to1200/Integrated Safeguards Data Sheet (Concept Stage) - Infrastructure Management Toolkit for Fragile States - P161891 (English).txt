    B. Project Development Objective(s)
    Improvement of the understanding of infrastructure design, financing and management in fragile states
    and situations.
    C. Project Description
    ISE has developed a methodology for developing manuals and toolkits. The core of the ISE team was
    originally based at the World Bank and developed toolkits for the World Bank community and partner
    governments internally. ISE now develops manuals and toolkits for multiple stakeholders including
    governments and development partners, including private sector and citizens.

    For this knowledge product, ISE will follow the following steps:
    (1) Refine and further develop its existing draft infrastructure manuals based on expert feedback;
    (2) Identify existing materials and where appropriate draft additional materials for two particular areas of
    emphasis – managing the infrastructure process in fragile states and citizen engagement;
    (3) Build an online portal and pilot self-instruction component;
    (4) Hold a workshop/ conference to provide input to and launch the product.

    For the production of its manuals, ISE draws on the expertise of its “network of networks” including
    partner organizations with relevant expertise, and contributors in the development and review of the
    same. Within that network, ISE is fortunate to have individuals who have extensive experience in the
    development of e-government and interactive platforms designed to address broad societal needs. ISE

                                                Page 1 of 3
will draw on these resources in the development of the Infrastructure Portal.

There are numerous sites which publish material, provide forms of self-instruction, and/or encourage the
development of online community around a given topic. There is, based on ISE research, no portal
focused on infrastructure PPPs in LICs, providing self-taught content. ISE’s direct experience in the
field, including in Afghanistan, South Sudan, Kosovo, Haiti, East Timor, Nepal, Guinea Bissau,
Burundi, Liberia, and Lebanon, in developing manuals and training for leaders and managers in fragile
states, and access to world class online development experts will allow for the creation of such a portal.

ISE will use both in person and virtual methods to make the learning tools available to the broader
community of interest in infrastructure investment. ISE will use its existing network of collaborating
organizations, to include, but not limited to, the g7+, regional development banks, host nation
governments in Africa, Southwest Asia and Latin America, and other NGOs and bilateral development
organizations such as DFID, Norad and DFAT with whom ISE continues to collaborate. In addition, the
ISE communications team will use its knowledge to disseminate the value of the portal.

ISE’s core team members are frequent speakers at WBG, international conferences and other events.
They will use those occasions to highlight the implementation of the ten governmental functions in a
broadly accessible format.

In addition, ISE will host a conference of practitioners of gathering input and implementing
infrastructure and public private partnerships in fragile states with a focus on citizen participation to both
gather lessons learned, but also to conduct rapid development of a prototype and gather feedback on its
efficacy.

ISE also functions as a network of networks and partners with a broad range of relevant partners for its
work. For the infrastructure manual, ISE will partner with CGLA Infrastructure who have a long track
record in producing knowledge and convening conferences for infrastructure including the Global
Infrastructure Forum. ISE will also identify other partners to ensure dissemination and outreach of this
product.
