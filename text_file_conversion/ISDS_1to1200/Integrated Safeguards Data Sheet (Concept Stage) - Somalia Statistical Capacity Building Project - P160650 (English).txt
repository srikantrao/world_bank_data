                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           9.       The PDO is to strengthen the capacity of the statistical authorities in the Federal Government
                           of Somalia, the Government of Puntland and the Government of Somaliland to provide a better
                           statistical infrastructure and enhance dissemination practices.
                           C. Project Description
                           11.       The project has three components: (a) Institutional Reform; (b) Human Capacity Building;
                           and (c) Statistical Data Infrastructure. The first component will deliver a drafted legal framework for
                           statistics and data dissemination policies. The second component will provide trainings. The third
                           component will update the sample frame and setup a micro-data library.

                           12.      Institutional Reform: A good legal framework is a necessity to create a sustainable statistical
                           system. Equally important are open data access policies to maximize usage of data but also create
                           better accountability and transparency. This component will use international experience to help
                           Somali authorities to draft a forward-looking legal framework for Statistics and open data access
                           policies. It will also support advocacy and coordination for Statistics in Somalia.

                           13.     Human Capacity: Staff at the statistical authorities has limited experience in Statistics and is
                           generally either not at all or not well trained. This component aims to provide some of the key staff
                           training contributing to the creation of a professional civil service work force. Trainings will cover
                           basic and intermediary trainings including Excel, National Accounts and poverty analysis trainings.
                           Female staff will have preferential access to the trainings with a minimum quota reflected also in the

                           results framework.

                           14.     Statistical Data Infrastructure: A comprehensive sample frame is a necessity to conduct
                           representative sample surveys. The current sample frame is incomplete and insufficient for this
                           purpose. Therefore, the component will produce a revised sample frame using satellite imagery.
                           Given the specialized skillset needed for this task, a contractor will be hired for this activity. The
                           component will also create a micro-data library to offer a platform to provide datasets including a
                           description of the dataset in standardized format.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project will not include any works. Safeguard responsibilities are transferred to the practice
                           manager as no safeguards are triggered.
