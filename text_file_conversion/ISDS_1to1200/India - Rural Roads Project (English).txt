I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The project development objective is to achieve broader and more sustainable access to markets and
social services by the rural population in project areas.
The project is being proposed as the first in a series of credits/loans to the Government of India to support
the implementation of the Prime Minister's Rural Road Program (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana,
PMGSY) in up to four states in the first instance. The PMGSY is a centrally sponsored scheme that seeks
to achieve all weather access to every habitation with a population greater than 1000 by 2003, and all
habitations of greater than 500 people by the end of the 10th Plan, 2007.
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project is anticipated to have three components:
(i)    new construction, upgradation and rehabilitation of about 10,000 km of rural roads that form part
of the core rural road network in at least four states, including necessary environmental
management measures, land acquisition (financed by states and local government), R&R of any
project affected persons, and technical review of rural road agency designs and supervision ($349
million of which $314 million is Bank);
(ii)   annual implementation of periodic and routine maintenance programs of the remaining core rural
network in those districts receiving Bank funding under component (i), in all about 50,000 km
($224 million of which $0 is Bank); and
(iii)  technical assistance and goods to (a) participating rural road agencies to help them plan, procure,
supervise and report on their maintenance programs, including environmental and social
management and (b) local contractors for training in planning, technical and environmental areas
and (c) to the NRRDA to further strengthen its capacity in program management, particularly in
the areas of environmental, social, financial and procurement management as well as poverty
impact assessment. ($13.41 million of which $11.95 million is Bank).

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or
sites or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The proposed project is to support the on-going program of PMGSY. The project proposes to construct,
upgrade, and maintain existing tracks to all-weather roads of selected links in rural areas in some or all of
the districts in four states (possibly Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Himalchal Pradesh). The
Environment and Social Assessments (E&SA) has identified the broad characteristics of the area and
associated magnitude of impacts.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: A (Full Assessment)
Comments: The project is categorized as "A" so as not to exclude any rural road from potential inclusion
under the project. In general, sub projects are not likely to cause significant or irreversible adverse
impacts and generic management procedures will apply. However, on those roads in sensitive areas or
with above average potential social consequences, as determined through sub-project screening,
additional assessment and safeguard management measures will be applied.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not
available, describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. Ia. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Environmental Assessment OP 4.01: Adverse environment impacts are likely to occur if selected roads
are not properly planned, designed or constructed. Impacts of improper construction practices; material
management such as borrow area and quarry operation; location and operation of hot-mix plants and
construction/labor camps; disposal of debris and bituminous waste; and embankment/slope stability can
become significant in the project if not addressed appropriately at various stages. Some roads may
traverse through forests or other protected or ecologically sensitive areas providing connectivity to inner
villages, leading to associated ecological impacts. Hill roads in particular face risks of slope failure
leading to accentuated landslides and erosion. Debris disposal in these areas is also a major environment
issue.

Natural Habitat OP 4.04: The project will include the flexibility to include sensitive environments
where necessary to fulfill the objective of total connectivity.
Forests OP4.36: To be determined at the time of appraisal with respect to 'projects that have or may
have impacts on the health and quality of forests' in case of roads through such areas.
Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12 & Indigenous People OD 4.20: Even though the local population
will benefit with better accessibility there may be some who will be negatively affected, including tribals.
These impacts include loss of immobile assets. The affected titleholders may lose part of their total
holding or other structures. In the case of non-titleholders, there may be crop loss or structures may be
affected.
Cultural Property OPN 11.03: There may be a possibility of "chance finds" during earthwork phase of
construction, or impacts on existing culturally sensitive properties along the roadside.
II.D.lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy
or due to multiple project component.
Cumulative impacts can occur due to the application of OP4.01 and OP4.12 or OP4.30. The
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) would help manage and mitigate any
cumulative impacts.
II.D. 1 c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Potential long terms impacts may include changes in land use patterns and occupations of people.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
E&SA for PMGSY has been conducted using a framework approach. Its output is an Environmental and
Social Management framework which includes: (i) a screening and consultation framework; (ii) standard
environmental codes of practice (ECOPs); (iii) a resettlement policy framework; and (iv) a tribal
development strategy. Implementation of the ESMF (including the ECoPs) will be the responsibility of
officers of the executing agencies in each state (such as Public Works Departments or Rural Engineering
Departments or dedicated state-wise Rural Road Development Agencies), under the overall co-ordination
and monitoring of the NRRDA. A Project Operational Manual will integrate the ESMF in projects
operations. To implement measures beyond the jurisdiction of the executing agencies, such as land
acquisition, plantation along the road sides, mining for stone and sand, Memoranda of Understanding
(MoUs) will be signed between the executing agencies and relevant Line Agencies. Specific
responsibilities of these line agencies have been indicated in the ESMF, depending on technical capacity
or jurisdiction.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The participation of stakeholders is envisaged at different levels i.e. Center, State, district, block and
village level to involve various government departments (revenue), PRI, NGOs/CBOs and project
affected people. The objective of this broad participation is to enhance the overall design of the project
and sub-projects, establishing realistic roles and responsibilities and develop a screening and consultative

framework. This framework will be based on the assessment of current consultation practices being
carried out for planning and implementation e.g. local consultations are on-going to develop core network
plans. It will include an information dissemination strategy, participatory mechanisms by which
communities (including the vulnerable e.g. tribals, women) and project authorities can continue
consultation. The draft environmental and social assessment reports including the ESMF, screening and
consultative framework will be publicly available with relevant summaries in local languages in
Panchayat offices at suitable locations.
E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any
policy. Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard
policy is triggered the provisions of that policy apply.
] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional
risks in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
S3. - No safeguard issues
] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
