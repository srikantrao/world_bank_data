A.2. Project Objectives: 
Support the modernization of Vietnamese agriculture and enhance water resources management 
by improving irrigation services through the introduction of modern hydraulic infrastructure and 
management; 
Reduce flood and disaster risk by improving dam safety and management; and 
Promote the environmentally sustainable development of Thu Bon Basin through integrated 
development and management of water resources. 
 
A.3. Project Description:
 
Component 1: Irrigation Modernization (US$153.7 million)
: The component will renovate and 
modernize the infrastructure and management of six of the largest schemes in Vietnam: 
 
 
The hydraulic infrastructure will be upgraded to make water delivery more reliable, flexible, 
efficient, and equitable. This will be achieved by renovating degraded canals, installing new types of 
water control and flow measurement structures, and developing lower level canal systems.  The 
safety of dams supplying water for the schemes will be improved through remedial works, such as 
emergency spillways, slope reinforcement, motorizing spillway gates, and repairing outlet works. 
Modernizing the infrastructure will enable the schemes to supply more water to a wider variety of 
agricultural, municipal, and industrial users, and enhance overall water resource management 
capacity. The project also aims to improve the management of the schemes so new infrastructure can 
be effectively utilized.  Implementation of the subprojects will proceed in phases. The first phase 
consists of dam safety works, main canals, and approximately 20% of the distribution area for each 
subproject. The remaining 80% of the command area would be upgraded in subsequent phases.
 
 
Dam Safety (US$10.2 million)
: US$7.0 million will be reserved for upgrading additional, to-be 
identified, dams during implementation. A MARD national dam safety unit will be established under 
the project to improve the management of all MARD-affiliated dams, with a focus on the six dams 
in Component 1, including preparing dam safety and emergency management plans, dam safety 
inspections, and formulating and enforcing laws and regulations. Approximately US$1.0 million 
will be used for supporting the start-up of the dam safety unit.
 
 
The component also finances the improvement of the Hoa Binh dam safety instrumentation system 
(US$1.2 million).  The reservoir is owned and operated by the Electricity Authority of Vietnam 
(EVN), but is under the control of the Central Committee for Flood Protection during the wet 
season.

Component 3: Thu Bon Basin Development (US$3.9 million)
: The component will fund the high 
priority Quang Hue River Flow Stabilization ($2.9) works, which controls the flow of water to the 
cities of Danang and Hoi An. Approximately US$1.0 million will be reserved for planning and pre-
investment studies for priority projects identified in the Thu Bon River Basin Master Plan, which 
could be considered for follow-up financing by the World Bank. 
 
Component 4: Project Management and Capacity Building (US$8.7 million)
: Training (US$2.4 
million) and technical assistance (US$3.5 million) are essential to implementing the project and will 
be funded this component. The project will also help cover incremental operating costs for the 
various project management units ($2.8 million).
 
 
A.4. Project Location and Salient Physical Characteristics: 
 
Component 1
: Of the six irrigation subprojects, four (Yen Lap, Ke Go, Phu Ninh, and Da Ban) are 
located along the central coast, one subproject (Cam Son-Cau Son) is located in the north near Hanoi, 
and one subproject (Dau Tieng) is located in the south near Ho Chi Minh City. These subprojects lie 
in the tropical monsoon climate with two distinct seasons (rainy and dry), but the duration varies with 
specific locations of the subprojects. There are a number of national forest reserves located in the 
reservoir catchment areas of the subprojects, but not in the command areas. A number of cultural 
heritage sites also exist near the command areas. Most of the forest areas are covered with secondary 
or regeneration forest and limited natural cover in the hill areas. Most of the land use in the command 
areas is for agriculture (rice, bean, vegetable), however, there are also industries, communities, and 
aquaculture development.   
 
The six subprojects have a command area of 133,000 ha, with approximately 125,000 farmer 
household beneficiaries (approximately 600,000 people). Since the reservoir/irrigation schemes serve 
multiple uses such as flood control, municipal and industrial water supply, etc. the estimated number 
of beneficiaries is 3.6 million. Approximately 98-99% of the residents in the irrigation command area 
are Kinh people, but there are significant populations of ethnic minorities living in the higher areas 
surrounding the irrigation schemes.  
 
Water quality in most reservoirs generally good, however there is tendency towards eutrophication.  
Phu Ninh subproject has a serious problem with aquatic weeds both in the reservoir and irrigation 
canals. Water quality in most command areas is generally acceptable. In the area with high residential 
population (Cam Son-Cao Son and Ke Go), the irrigation canals also receive untreated wastewater 
and other wastes from industry and communities. For Yen Lap and Dau Tieng, industries discharge 
large amount of wastewater either into the command areas or downstream of the command areas.   
 
Many of these industries are old with no capacity for wastewater treatment. Pesticide levels in 
surface waters of the command areas are unknown. Groundwater quantity, particularly the shallow 
aquifers, has improved after the operation of the scheme. There are salinity intrusion problems at a 
lower end of the schemes which are located near or in the coastal areas.  Some specific details of the 
subprojects are briefly described below. 
 
Cam Son - Cau Son
 scheme is situated at the edge of the Red River Delta in Bac Giang Province 
about 50 kms from Hanoi. The Cam Son Reservoir receives water from a catchment area of about 
378 km2; the 37 meter high dam is in generally good condition but needs minor renovations. The 
beneficiary population is estimated to be 650,000, with around 100,000 people farmer-households in 
the command area. A number of industries are located near Bac Giang town, including fertilizer 
p
lant, breweries, etc.  Due to limited availabilit
y
 of water available for irri
g
ation in the lower end of 
Page  5
 
 
the scheme, about 42% of untreated wastewater from the fertilizer plan (about 27.3 million m3/yr) is 
presently used for irrigation; with improved water management under the project this will be replaced 
by clean water. Cam Son Weir was constructed in the early 1900s and has been assigned as an 
Historical and Cultural Site. 
 
Yen Lap
 scheme is situated in Quang Ninh Province in the northeast coast about 170 km north-east of 
Hanoi. The scheme is part of the coastal fringe of the Red River Delta, which is a strong tidal 
influenced delta environment. The Yen Lap reservoir receives water from a catchment area of about 
183 km2. The 37 meter high dam needs substantial renovation.  The project will supply bulk water 
supply to Cat Hai Island, which is approximately 500 meter off the mainland.  Historically, the 
coastal wetland was more than 35,000 ha. At present, however, there is only 10,000 ha left in the Yen 
Hung District. The losses are due to conversion to aquaculture, fire wood exploitation, agriculture, 
alteration of tidal regime caused by dike construction. Data indicate that regional biodiversity value is 
significant.  A number of protected areas are located in the catchment and downstream of the 
subproject (Bai Chai Cultural and Historic Site, Ky Thoung Nature Reserve, Cat Bai National Park, 
Halong Bay, Yen Lap Protection Areas). 
 
Ke Go
 is located in Ha Tinh Province in north central Viet Nam about 300 km south of Hanoi. The 
Ke Go Reservoir (20 yr, 320 million m3, 37m) is located about 20 km south of Ha Tinh Town, and 
needs substantial renovation.  There are approximately 300,000 project beneficiaries and about 
20,000 farmer-households (100,000 people) in the command area. The 223 km catchment area 
contains the Ke Go Nature Reservoir. Ha Tinh province is rather isolated and has low levels of 
economic and agricultural development. 
 
Phu Ninh
 scheme is located in Quang Nam Province, approximately 50 kms south of Da Nang.  The 
catchment area of the reservoir is 235 km and the dam (40 m high) is in generally good condition. 
There are approximately 18,000 farmer-households (90,000 people) in the command area and 
411,000 project beneficiaries. The province has an ambitious industrial and aquatic development 
program, although the economic viability of these plans are uncertain.  
 
Da Ban
 scheme is located in Khanh Hoa Province, on the south central coast of Vietnam (about 500 
km north of Ho Chi Minh City).  This is a water scare area and very little development was present 
before the operation of the scheme. There are approximately 250,000 beneficiaries and 8,000 farmer-
households in the command area. The Da Ban Reservoir is located about 35 km north of Nha Trang, 
the provincial capital.  The catchment area of the reservoir is 126 km2, located in the Vong Phu 
Mountain Range.  Physical condition of the dam (42 m high) is very poor (crack/seepage), the 
spillway is under-designed, and the dam needs immediate remedial works. The area around Nha 
Trang is a major tourist destination; the province also has a large and fastest growing aquaculture 
industry but provincial authorities are committed to making Khanh Hoa a model for good aquaculture 
development in Hanoi. 
 
Dau Tieng
 is the largest irrigation scheme in the country, and covers Tay Ninh province and Ho Chi 
Minh City Municipality. The Reservoir, with a main dam 28 m high, 1.1 km long and an 
embankment dam 10 m high and 26 km long, is sited on the Sai Gon River, 20 km kilometers east of 
Tay Ninh town and 120 km north of Ho Chi Minh City. The dam structure is stable after some 
emergency works in 2000, but needs substantial renovation to achieve acceptable levels of safety. 
 
The Dau Tieng scheme was financed by the IDA in the early 1980s. There are approximately 1.6 
million project beneficiaries, and about 50,000 farmer-households (250,000 people) in the command 
area. The area is situated in the moist forest ecological region and relative rich in biological value. Lo 
Go-Sa Mat National Park is located in the u
pp
er catchment while Duon
g
 Minh Chau Cultural and 
Page  6
 
 
Historic Site; Nui  Ba Den Cultural and Historic Site; Boi Loi Cultural and Historic Site; and Can 
Gio Biospere Reserve are located nearby the subproject. The greater Ho Chi Minh City is growing 
rapidly and the scheme currently provides significant amounts of municipal and industrial water to 
Tay Ninh and the Chu Chi District in HCMC. There are plans to make inter-basin transfers of water 
into Dau Tieng reservoir to expand the irrigated area and supply more municipal and industrial water 
to HCMC. 
 
Component 2: 
 Under the 
MARD Dam Safety Component
, approximately 3-5 high priority dams, in 
addition to the six dams under Component 1, will be identified for remedial safety works financed by 
the project. The location of the dams at this time, therefore, can not be ascertained. The nature of the 
remedial works is expected to be similar to the dams under Component 1. 
  
Under the 
EVN Dam Safety Component
 , Hoa Binh is the largest dam, reservoir, and electric power 
plant in Vietnam. The earth and rock fill dam is 123 meters high and 743 meters long, with a 
reservoir capacity of 10 billion cubic meters and 1920 MW of installed capacity. In addition to its 
national economic value, the scheme is located approximately 75 kms upstream of Hanoi, making 
safety of the dam and flood management operations are of paramount concern for the entire Red 
River delta. Hoa Binh was commissioned in the early 1990s and was constructed with the assistance 
of the former Soviet Union. The Da total catchment is about 51,700 km2 of which about 48% of the 
upper watershed is located in China.  Approximately 60,000 people were dislocated by the project, 
most of them Tai ethnic minority, and with minimal resettlement support. The Government of 
Vietnam has taken steps to address the resettlement problems in recent years, but there are still 
lingering legacy issues. 
 
Component 3: 
 The Quang Hue River subproject is located on the central west coast of Vietnam at 
the connection between the Quang Hue River and Vu Gia River. The Quang Hue-Vu Gia River 
Basins cover practically all the area of Quang Nam Province. A total drainage are is 11,510 km2 of 
which nearly half drain from the Vu Gia River. The area is highly complex and subject to major 
storms. High floods recently formed a natural “short-cut channel” between the two rivers, and 
severely reduced the dry season flow of the Vu Gai River which is an important water source for 
irrigation downstream and Danang City. Low water flow has also increased the sedimentation in the 
river and increased salinity intrusion.  The subproject will restore the water flow in Vu Gia river by 
constructing river training works .

Comments
: The EIA studies were carried out for the six subprojects under Component 1 and the 
Quang Hue-Vu Gai subproject under Component 3. The studies commented that according to the 
nature of the activities, mostly rehabilitation and upgrading of existing schemes, the negative impacts 
would be similar to those of the category “B” type and  no adverse impacts that are irreversible are 
anticipated. Most of the impacts can be mitigated through effective implementation of the 
environmental management plans. The following activities, however, have not been fully formulated 
during project preparation, and thus were not subject to full environmental assessment: i) subsequent 
phases of irrigation upgrading under Component 1; ii) remedial safety works for dams to be 
identified in the MARD Dam Safety Program; and iii) construction of very small hydro-met stations 
in the Da catchments in phase 2 of the EVN Hoa Binh activity. The impacts of the unidentified 
investments are expected to be relatively small and similar in nature to those identified in the EIA. In 
order to address this issue, it was proposed that an Environment and Social Safeguard Framework 
(ESSF) will be prepared and applied to all the new investments to be identified during the follow-on 
phases. A number of other related reports i.e. Consultation Report, Social Assessment Reports,

Section II-Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management 
D. Summary of Safeguard Issues 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
\01\02
OP4.01 --EAs/SAs
. While the project is classified as category A,  result of the EIA suggested that 
the scale and magnitude of the potential impacts are more like category B. Most of the impacts are 
site-specific, none are irreversible. Direct impacts on environmental sensitive areas such as 
wetlands, forests, or other natural habitat is very limited, and will be compensated as much as 
possible. The EMP for the project include the actions to mitigate the impacts during pre-
construction and construction stages as well as those to reduce the incremental impacts from 
irrigation and other non-irrigation uses. The investment activities to be identified and carried out 
during the follow-on phase of the project will be subject to Environmental and Social Safeguards 
Framework (ESSF), Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and Ethnic Minority Development 
Plan (EMDP) as needed.    
 
\01\02
OP 4.04 --Natural Habitat
.  
There will be loss of natural habitats in the Yen Lap Watershed 
Protection Forest from the construction of the emergency spillway, which will be compensated for 
by reforestation in the Yen Lap Watershed Protection Forest. For other subprojects there may be a 
loss of natural habitat due to to extraction of construction materials and excavation of soil for earth-
fill. Enforceable contract provisions governing the transport, as well as the sources of construction 
materials, are specified in the EIA. Bid documents and construction contracts will require the 
acquisition of construction material (sand, gravel and other materials) to meet stipulated 
environmental management standards, and only existing authorized borrow pits and licensed 
quarries are to be used. Measures for timely site stabilization and erosion control, rehabilitation and 
restoration to original are included in the EMP.  
 
\01\02
OP 4.09 --Pesticide management.
 The project will not finance procurement of pesticides, but 
modernization of irrigation schemes would increase crop diversification and cropping intensity 
which could lead to increased pesticide use.  Under current cultivation practices, pesticides are 
used extensively, and it is estimated approximately two-thirds of farmers in the project area have 
not received training in integrated pest management (IPM). The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural 
Develo

j
ect 
Page  8
 
 
provinces, and the project will monitor, and support if necessary, these activities.   
  
\01\02
OP4.36 --Forestry.
  Not triggered, but approximately 10 ha of degraded watershed protection forest 
will be lost due to the new construction of emergency spillway at Yen Lap which will be 
compensated for by reforestation of an equal or larger amount of land in the vicinity. Loss of forest 
cover in any subproject, although unlikely, will also be compensated by reforestation.  
 
\01\02
OPN 11.03 --Cultural property.
 Impacts are assessed as Unknown because, while the exact location 
of each cultural and historic sites in the project is known, the specific locations of activities for the 
follow-on phases is not yet known in detail. Safeguard screening will be made during the 
implementation to ensure that this policy will not be triggered.  Terms and conditions be included 
in construction contracts to ensure integrity of these resources.     
 
\01\02
OP4.12 –Involuntary Resettlement
. Seven Resettlement Action Plans have been prepared for Phase 
I activities, and a Resettlement Policy Framework has been formulated to guide resettlement 
planning in subsequent phases during implementation.  These resettlement action plans and policy 
have been reviewed and cleared by IDA.  The total amount of affected land in Phase 1 is 272 has, 
affecting 10,896 households. Over 99% of the affected households have less than 20% of their land 
holdings affected, and more than half of these households will only experience temporary land 
acquisition needed for construction purposes. All feasible efforts to reduce resettlement impacts 
were adopted during project preparation. Only 10 households in the Yen Lap subproject will need 
to be relocated, and only 45 households will lose more than 20% of their land. 
 
\01\02
OP 4.37 --Safety of Dams.
  Applied for all subprojects, except for Quang Hue river works. The 
dam safety aspects have been integrated in the Project and dam safety activities will be 
implemented in the project. An Independent Dam Safety Review panel will be established under 
the project. 
 
\01\02
OP 4.20 Indigenous Peoples.
 Social assessment exercises have been carried out in the project areas 
to identify and assess project impacts on them.  There are ethnic minority groups in the project 
areas and they are expected to benefit from the project.  There are ethnic minority groups in Phase I 
areas for the Cam Son subproject, and an ethnic minority development plan has been prepared.  A 
policy framework for ethnic minority people’s development has been prepared to guide planning of 
investment activities in Phase II. 
 
\01\02
OP7.60 Projects in Disputed Areas.
  Not triggered since none of the activities would involve 
disputed areas.  
 
\01\02
OP 7.50 International Waterways.
 Not triggered. Although nearly 50% of the Da watershed (Hoa 
Binh dam safety/flood forecasting)is located in China, the project activities will not (a)  change the 
quality or quantity of water flows to the other riparians; and (b)  affect other riparians possible 
water use.  During Phase II of the EVN Hoa Binh component, there may be discussions with China 
on cooperation related to flood forecasting.
 
 
D.2. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard 
policy or due to multiple project component. 
 
Cumulative impacts would be associated with the operational phase. Although the project develops no 
new sources of water, modernization of the irrigation schemes would improve reliability and efficiency 
of overall water use. This would contribute to increased water use b
y
 munici
p
alities and industries, and 
Page  9
 
 
in the absence of effective wastewater management, contribute to water pollution. Likewise, more 
reliable water supply would be a contributing factor to aquaculture development, potentially resulting 
in coastal/wetland degradation. Pesticide use could also increase due to cropping intensification. For 
the Cam Son subproject, more wastewater from Bac Giang Fertilizer Plant will be discharged into the 
Bac Giang river since the wastewater will not be longer used for irrigation.  
 
To address these indirect impacts, the Environmental Management Plan will review and support as 
necessary the following activities for each subproject: i) pesticide management; ii) water quality 
monitoring; iii) aquaculture; and iv) monitoring and enforcing compliance of wastewater discharges. 
 
D.3. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if relevant):  
 
Given project activities will be limited to rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing irrigation areas, 
site selection alternatives are limited. Significant consideration, however has been given to construction 
and planning (i.e. using canal lining material, concentrate construction activities during off-farm or 
rainy season when water user having alternative water source, etc) to minimize the need for land 
acquisition and/or reduce the impacts due to disruption of water supply during the construction. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
 
 
To ensure effective implementation of the EMPs, during appraisal, the following actions will be 
discussed and confirmed with MARD and its Project Management Office (PMO): 
 
Environment
 
\01\02
During appraisal, the PMO will prepare draft TORs for the Safeguard Consultants, finalize 
the specific environmental requirements to be included in the bidding document, and 
initiate a plan to build MARD capacity to implement the EMP and address the safeguard 
issues.  
 
\01\02
Within three months of  effectiveness, PMO will mobilize the Safeguard Consultant to be 
attached to PMO and the bidding document for the first investment package will include 
the environmental requirements. 
 
\01\02
Before construction, the MARD PMO, MARD Sub-Implementation Offices (SIOs), and 
provincial project management units (PMU)s will complete resettlement and land 
acquisition, prepare construction plan in consultation with local authority and water users 
groups. Close consultation with the local authority and communities will be maintained 
through out the project.  
 
\01\02
During construction stage, PMUs  and SIOs will ensure that the contractors are aware of 
their environmental obligations and ready to comply before signing the contracts. Field 
engineer will monitor the environmental performance of the contractors on a daily basis. 
Records must be kept in the monitoring file. The Safeguard Consultants will review the 
monitoring records and monitor the environmental condition, including the borrowing pits, 
and submit the monitoring reports. The monitoring plan will be prepared in line with the 
construction plan.  For Yen Lap, 10 ha of forest land are expected to be cut, PMO/PMU 
will ensure that at least 20 ha of forest area will be replanted to compensate for the forest 
loss. 
 
\01\02
To reduce the impacts due to the increased use pesticides and fertilizers during 
o
p
erations, PMO will 
p
re
p
are a 
p
lan for IPM activities in the subproject provinces and 
Page  10
 
 
submit a report to the Bank describing the extent of the problem, training program, and 
recommendations for improvements, including justification for financial support from 
VWRAP, a limited allocation of fund can be provided to the provinces; 
  
\01\02
To reduce other indirect impacts during operations, the Safeguard Consultants will 
assist PMO in the preparation of 
a "Strategic Environmental Assessment and Action 
Plan" that analyzes the following issues in so far as they relate to irrigation scheme 
operation: 
(a)  Design of Water Quality Monitoring Program;  
(b) Aquaculture;  
(c)  Municipal and Industrial Pollution Control;  
(d)  Reservoir Watershed Management; and  
(e) Other issues.  
 
The Action Plan should identify immediate actions necessary to address identified 
problems, and also prepare funding request for VWRAP support. 
 
\01\02
PMO will monitor the implementation progress of the EMP every six months and submit 
an annual EMP monitoring report to IDA not later than 2 months after the end of the fiscal 
year. The lesson learned and experience from the community participation process during 
the first phase implementation should be taken into account. 
 
\01\02
During follow-on phases, PMO assisted by the Safeguard Consultant will undertake 
screening process and the EMP as described in the ESSF. If the impacts are significant, 
consultation with IDA will be necessary and assistance from international consultants may 
be required. Monitoring of the agreed mitigation plans will be carried out through out the 
project. 
 
\01\02
PMO will establish a safeguard unit to be responsible for planning, supervision, and 
monitoring of the EMP and other safeguard activities. All the key staff from PMO and 
PMUs/SIOs will be trained on the EIA, ESSF, and other aspects of the safeguard and the 
training results should be included in the annual EMP monitoring report. Training of other 
MARD staff both at the central and provincial levels on safeguards, including dam safety, 
will be desirable.    
 
Resettlement:
 
 
\01\02
Information Dissemination Prior to Detailed Design
. 
Prior to the commencement of 
detailed design, MARD will provide information about the Project throughout the project 
area. Information meetings will be held in all potentially affected commune to inform the 
communities about (i) the project scope, (ii) impacts, (iii) entitlements for all categories of 
loss, (iv) schedule of activities beginning with the detailed design survey, (iv) institutional 
responsibilities, and (v) the grievance mechanism. The PIB will be prepared and 
distributed to all affected communities during the meetings. 
 
\01\02
Establishment of Resettlement Committees
. 
All provinces will establish their resettlement 
committees at provincial and district level as soon as the Project has been approved.  
 
\01\02
Training for Resettlement Staff.
 
Within 2 months of mobilization of the resettlement 
consultants for the PMO, all local resettlement staff at PPMU/SIO, PRC, DRC, and 
Page  11
 
 
commune levels will be trained by the PMO assisted by the consultants. Training subjects 
will include 
\03\02
procedures for preparing the RAPs; 
\03\02
consultation and information dissemination methods; 
\03\02
principles, policies, and entitlements of the RAPs; 
\03\02
implementation steps, procedures, and schedule; 
\03\02
grievance redress mechanism; and 
\03\02
powers and obligations of individuals/agencies involved in the process of 
resettlement programs. 
 
\01\02
Updating Compensation Rates
.
 During the preliminary detailed design process, the PPCs 
will update unit rates at replacement cost for all categories of loss and adjust allowances to 
account for inflation. This will be done in consultation with PAP and local government 
agencies. 
 
\01\02
Detailed Measurement Survey (DMS).
 Before each new phases of the VWRAP new DMS 
will be conducted in each subproject area after completion of the detailed design. These 
surveys will serve as a basis for compensation and new RAPs. Data will be computerized 
by  PMO. 
 
\01\02
Pricing Application and Compensation to PAP
.
 Resettlement committees at all levels will 
be responsible for pricing application and preparing compensation charts for each affected 
commune/district. These will be subject to verification by PPMU/SIO, PPCs, and PMO of 
unit prices, quantity of affected assets, PAP entitlements, etc. before posting them at each 
commune for the people to review and comment. All compensation forms must be checked 
and signed by the PAP to indicate their agreement. 
 
\01\02
Compensation and Allowances will be handled at commune level under the supervision of 
representatives of DRCs and PPMU/SIO. Guidance will be given by PPMU/SIOs to aid 
local resettlement committees in making payments to PAP.  
 
\01\02
Monitoring and Evaluation
. 
Internal and external monitoring shall start as soon as the 
updated RAPs have been approved. Monitoring will continue throughout the construction 
period. A replacement cost survey should be conducted by the external monitoring 
organization prior to or during DMS to update and advice PPC on compensation rates. A 
post-resettlement evaluation will also be undertaken by the external monitoring 
organization 6 to 12 months after completion of all resettlement activities. 
 
\01\02
Safeguard Consultants will develop action plans and oversee implementation of (a) 
integrated pest management training in project areas, (b) water quality monitoring 
program; and (c) other items indicated in the EMP. An annual management reports should 
be submitted to IDA not later than 2 months after the end of the fiscal year.  
 
\01\02
During follow-on phases, PMO assisted by the Safeguard Consultant will undertake the 
screen screening process for currently unidentified investments per the ESSF. If the 
impacts are significant, consultation with IDA will be necessary and assistance from 
international consultants may be required. Monitoring of the agreed mitigation plans will 
be carried out through out the project. 
 
 
Page  12
 
 
Capacity 
of the provincial (PMUs) and national implementing agency (MARD PMO and SIOs) is 
limited, but they are committed to carry out the agreed mitigation and management plans. The project 
will finance training for the implementing agencies, as well as contracts, and provincial staffs. The 
PMO will contract international and national consultants to assist in the implementation of the EMP.
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key provincial stakeholders include farmer groups, Irrigation Management Companies (IMCs), 
project-affected people, provincial governments and their agricultural and rural development 
departments. At the national level, the various MARD departments and Ministries of Finance, Planning 
and Investments, and Environment are important stakeholders. 
 
A number of consultations with concerned agencies and affected population were carried out during the 
preparation of the EIAs/SIAs and RAPs. The first round consultation was made during the initial stage 
of the EIAs/SIAs/RAPs through questionnaires and selective meetings and discussion with the local 
authorities, identified project affected people, and relevant stakeholders of the pilot areas. The second 
consultation was carried out through a workshop with provincial and national officials at Dao Son in 
Haiphong province in July 2003 when the draft final EIAs/RAPs were available. A consultation report 
was submitted to the Bank before appraisal. Additional consultation will be made in September 2003 to 
discuss the EIA findings, and the respective EMPs and RAPs with the local authorities and 
communities. The results will be used in finalizing the EMPs and RAPs and will be included (as an 
addendum) to the consultation report. The EMP will be finalized during appraisal after discussion and 
confirmation with the agencies and completion of the consultation with the stakeholders.
