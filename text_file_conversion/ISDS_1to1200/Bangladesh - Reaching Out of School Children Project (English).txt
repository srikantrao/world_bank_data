A.2. Project Objectives 
 
In consonance with PEDP II, the key objective of this project is to provide access to quality 
primary education to out-of-school children to support GoB towards achieving its national EFA 
goals. In particular, through demand-side mechanisms, the Project aims to: 
\01\02
Expand access to quality primary education–especially for the disadvantaged; 
\01\02
Increase completion and transition rates for students enrolled in Learning Centers; 
\01\02
Achieve comparable or better classroom conditions for students in Learning Centers as 
compared to formal schools; and 
\01\02
Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of well-defined demand-side intervention to address specific 
problems of quality and access to primary education. 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
(a) 
Improving Access to Quality Education for Out-of-School Children
. 
 
To support 
schooling for out-of-school children and to facilitate their completion of primary schooling 
through the provision of (i) education allowances for eligible students; and (ii) grants to learning 
centers/schools where these students enroll. 
 
(b) 
Project Management and Institutional Strengthening
.  (i) To establish a sound structure 
for project management and implementation; and (ii) to strengthen the capacity to deliver quality 
primary education to out-of-school children. 
 
(c) 
Monitoring, Evaluation and Research
.  (i) To provide an effective monitoring and 
evaluation system to monitor the use of education allowances and grants support; and (ii) evaluate
 
the above two programs. 
 
(d) 
Communications and Social Awareness
.  (i) To raise awareness on proposed project 
activities at community, Upazila and national levels; (ii) to mobilize families, communities, and 
local “Education Service Providers” to open new learning centers or expand existing centers; and 
(

 to disseminate information on

guidelines to all stakeholders. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The Project would cover primary education activities for out-of-school children in about 40 upazilas, both 
in rural and urban areas, which may include tribal areas. The Learning Centers are rented from the 
community, therefore, civil works and related land acquisition is not required for this project. 
 
 
B. Check Environmental Category

Comments:  As the Project does not involve any construction, there would be no adverse environmental 
impacts resulting from project activities. The Project would ensure that the community would provide safe 
drinking water through reasonable means and appropriate sanitation facilities for the learning centers.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Operational policies triggered pertains to Environment (OP 4.01) and Indigenous Peoples (OD 
4.20. No civil works is planned, therefore OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement  is not triggered 
and environmental risks would be minimal.  The main environmental concerns are availability of 
arsenic-safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities at the learning centers.   A detailed 
Social and Environmental Assessment was carried out for the Second Primary Education 
Development Project (PEDP-II) recently.  Environmental guidelines have been developed and 
disclosed  accordingly.  In addition, a rapid assessment on non-formal education institutions was 
carried out  and PEDP-II Environment Guidelinewas expanded for non-formal learning centers. 
This Guideline  was discussed with the Government and disclosed. 
 
Tribal population
:  Tribal population consists of about 1% of the total population, and they 
reside mainly in the hilly areas of south-east and northern part of the country. All tribal groups 
have
 
distinct cultural identities and distinct languages, which are different from the mainstream 
language Bangla. Enrollment rates remain very low for tribal population living in rural areas, 
compared to mainstream population. Language is one of the major barrier for tribal children in 
accessing education. Also, inadequate physical facilities and difficult terrain in hilly areas often 
create serious barriers for tribal children in accessing education. Furthermore, most tribal children 
are from economically disadvantaged families, and they start earning a living from early age.  
Most of them work in crop cultivation, food for work activities, stone collection, in horticulture 
gardens, tea leaves plucking, 
jhum 
cultivation and fuel wood collection at a very low wage. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area. 
N/A. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
N/A 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The borrower has developed an  Environmental Guideline for PEDP-II, which covers the total 
primary education in public sector in Bangladesh. Furthermore, the borrower has carried out a 
rapid assessment on nonformal learning centers and expanded the Guideline for ensuring 
availability of safe drinking water and sanitation to students. 
Similarly the project will implement  the Tribal Development Plan of PEDP-II which covers all 
the tribal areas of Bangladesh, which was prepared and disclosed earlier.   
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders are the students, community, Center Management Committees/PTAs, NGOs, local 
representatives and government officials.   Social and environmental assessment was carried out using 
participatory methods and consulting with major stakeholder groups, including tribal communities.
