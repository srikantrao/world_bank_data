                           The proposed project with two fundamental pillars will, if implemented, help establish a realistic and well-grounded
                           national strategy for the statistical development and strengthen the national account system, and a sustainable data
                           production in Djibouti

                           1. The development objective of the NSDS pillar of the proposed project is to prepare a new national strategy
                           document for statistics development that will be feasible and realistic. This will entails sectorial analyses to identify the
                           main constraints to the statistical system development in Djibouti and organization of workshops to discuss and
                           disseminate the strategies among stakeholders and donors.
                           2. The development objective of the National account pillar of the project:
                           The achievements with the supports from the ADB and UNDP remain partial and preliminary. Meanwhile, the capacity
                           of the technical staff of the DISED remains weak with the short live of the previous training period. Securing the current
                           achievements and further strengthening the statistical capacity in Djibouti requires some short and medium term
                           efforts. Mainly:
                           (i)      the continuation of the technical team’s capacity building to engage resolutely in sustained production of
                           national accounts indicators;
                           (ii)     Putting in place important devices allowing the provision of relevant inputs to the compilation of national
                           accounts at constant prices to measure the actual performance of the economy. These include among others:
                           enterprise statistics from the establishment of a business directory and associated indicators; indicators of economic
                           activity: price indexes and volume of industrial activities, index of turnover, foreign trade indices, etc; the development
                           of the accounts for 2015 and 2016 (final accounts 2015 and provisional 2016 to the year 2017); retropolation of old
                           series (2008-2012) using the new system of accounts; and publication and training in the use of classifications of
                           activities and products.
