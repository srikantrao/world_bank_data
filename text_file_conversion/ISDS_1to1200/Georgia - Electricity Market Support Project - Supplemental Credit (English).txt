A.2. Project Objectives 
The objective of seeking supplemental IDA funding to the EMSP project is to achieve, in 
combination with other efforts, improvements to financial and corporate management in 
the power transmission company GSE to such an extent that the company becomes a 
financially viable entity.  The purpose of this Supplemental Credit is, therefore, to 
provide additional support to the project, beyond the original plan, in order to help the 
Government to sustain improved management efforts (through financing for a longer 
time the management contractor, thus at a greater cost to IDA than originally planned) 
and sustain the momentum of investments related to improved financial management.   
A.3. Project Description 
The existing EMSP project mainly finances a SCADA system (with energy management 
system, metering, and telecommunication) for the Georgian State Electrosystem (GSE), 
the Georgian power transmission company.  It also co-finances a management contract 
with an international contractor for GSE. Other components, mainly financed by KfW, 
finance system rehabilitation.  The Supplemental Credit has two components: 
 
1. Rehabilitation of Transmission System 
Under this component (including some funds from the original EMSP project), GSE will 
purchase nearly 1,100 wholesale meters to be installed in the system in substations of 110 
kV down to 6kV/10kV feeders.  This metering will allow better control of the low 
voltage part of the transmission system, and will enable the transmission company and 
the distribution company to significantly reduce commercial losses.  In the same region 
where the meters will be installed, GSE will also invest in new, modernized switchgear, 
auxiliary batteries and chargers, replacing equipment that often is more than 35 years old.  
Page  2
The new equipment will allow GSE to better control the load (additional cost savings), 
protect expensive equipment from damage, and also provide end users with more 
predictable power supply.  Most of the investments will take place in the region of 
Imereti, where the potential for improvements is the largest. 
 
2. Management Contract for the Transmission Company 
This component will finance the management contract for GSE (held by the Irish firm 
ESBI) by an extra 6 months until end May 2005.  Other financing sources for this 
contract are KfW and GSE’s own cash flow.  The additional funding is necessary during 
a
period where many operations are underway to help remedy the financial crisis in the 
power sector, including the Government’s plan to finance redundancy packages and 
salary arrears for 1500 employees in GSE, and USAID’s plans to extend a management 
contract and provide other funding for UDC, a large distribution company and GSE’s 
largest debtor.  ESBI’s management contract for GSE has a five-year duration to 
December 2007. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The equipment will be installed inside existing power system substations, thus no land 
acquisition will be required.  Most equipment will be located in the Imereti region of 
Georgia.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
In accordance with OP/BP/GP 4.01, the EMSP project has been rated Environmental 
Category B.  The reason for this rating was the inclusion of transmission network 
components and associated potential environmental issues.  The new system 
rehabilitation component in the Supplemental Credit is considered environmentally 
similar to existing components under the EMSP project, and thus does not change the 
environmental category.  The scope of the component is limited, and no potentially large 
scale, significant and/or irreversible negative impacts are identified.  The work involves 
replacement of existing equipment, and there will be no expansions of the substations or 
construction of new facilities.  An environmental analysis and management plan 
(including mitigating measures) was carried out as part of the technical feasibility study 
for the EMSP project (Fichtner: Environmental Analysis and Management Plan for the 
500 kV substation Sestafoni, Georgia, December 2000).  The analysis revealed, among 
other, extensive oil leakages to the ground (not including PCB), a problem that is typical 
for many of the substations in Georgia, and thus a likely occurrence at some of the 
substations in which meters, batteries and switchgear will be installed under the 
Supplemental Credit.  The switchgear to be procured under the Supplemental Credit will 
be environmentally benign vacuum circuit breakers, replacing old, oil-filled, leaky 
breakers.  The old breakers will be removed and discarded in accordance with 
environmentally appropriate methods and applicable legislation. The analysis found that 
the EMSP project will have no appreciable adverse environmental impacts, and will have 
environmental benefits associated with better performance of the new equipment. This 
conclusion is considered applicable also for the new components financed by the 
Supplemental Credit. Financed under the EMSP project, GSE will develop a transmission 
system environmental action plan, i.e. a plan that stretches beyond the specific 
investment components under the project. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
It is not expected that there will be any negative long-term impacts due to project 
activities in the project area.  To the contrary, the new investments will have a positive 
impact in the project area, as described under D.1.  In a wider context, the supplemental 
investment components will cause reduced power consumption, and thus reduced 
emissions from thermal power plants. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Not applicable. 
 
Page  4
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been developed for the investment 
components (switchgear, batteries, chargers) under this Supplemental Credit to the EMSP 
project. The sub-borrower GSE is managed by Irish firm ESBI, which has considerable 
environmental experience from its operation of the Irish transmission grid and activities 
in other countries.  The EMSP project has a competent PIU that is expected to perform 
satisfactorily together with the sub-borrower also in the environmental area. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The project components are similar to project components under the parent project 
EMSP, which had consultative and disclosure measures undertaken during project 
preparation.  In addition, the existence of and availability of an EMP has been announced 
in local language in the “Republic of Georgia” newspaper (the Government’s medium for 
announcements) on May 21, 2004.  As detailed knowledge of specific locations are 
known, consultations will be held locally.  The effect on the population is considered 
modest and of short duration due to the limited nature of the civil work and the fact that 
the work is done inside power substations, often at a distance from population centers.
