A.2. Project Objectives 
 
1. 
The overall purpose of the Program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the 
Province within a framework of fiscal responsibility as a means of supporting the return to a 
sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and increase social equity. To this end, 
the Province is prioritizing a set of interventions under the infrastructure Program for the period 
2005-2010 specifically aimed to: 
 
i. 
Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of 
the Province, to implement the infrastructure Program following sound fiscal 
policies to ensure convergence towards a long-term sustainable fiscal 
framework.  
ii. 
Improve and maintain high priority segments of the paved road network to 
support the reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen regional 
competitiveness.  
iii. 
Enhance water and sewerage services to low-income people living in highly 
vulnerable areas and to mitigate urban flooding. 
 
2.  The overall and specific objectives of this Project are consistent with the Country 
Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on April 14, 2004
1
,
which seeks to 
reduce the extent and severity of poverty in Argentina by focusing on: (i) promoting 
sustained economic growth with equity; (ii) social inclusion; and (iii) improved 
governance through strengthening institutions and increasing accountability and

Page  2
transparency.  The CAS envisages infrastructure assets as one of the building blocks for 
sustained economic growth.  
 
3. 
This Project is strongly aligned with these objectives. The rebuilding of the infrastructure 
asset base of the Province while pursuing gradual convergence towards fiscal balance is 
an essential step towards sustained economic growth. Furthermore, by promoting fiscal 
responsibility and building institutional capacity within the provincial government, 
particularly in public agencies responsible for infrastructure provision, the Project aims to 
deliver strategic frameworks and policy outlines on which to develop future infrastructure 
plans that contribute to reduce the extent of poverty in the Province.
 
4.  By enhancing the provincial road network, expected transport cost reductions would 
contribute to foster regional productivity and competitiveness with respect to both local 
and international markets. Regarding proposed investments in water supply and 
sewerage, the Project is designed so as to not pre-judge the outcome of on-going 
negotiations between concessionaires and the conceding authorities, promote equal 
regulatory treatment of all public and private service providers under a jurisdiction and 
ensure that such actions are consistent with a context of economic and financial 
sustainability.  The targeting methodology of the water and sanitation program will 
ensure that the benefits of extended infrastructure services are concentrated on areas 
where poverty is above a defined threshold. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
(See Annex 4 for details) 
 
5. 
Component 1 
–
Provincial Roads (Estimated Cost US$136.2 million of which U$ 101.2 
million will be financed by the Bank Loan)
:
This component seeks to rehabilitate high 
priority segments of the productive road network, remove critical bottlenecks and 
implement a sustained and cost-efficient maintenance program over the entire network, to 
reduce transport costs within the Province and improve its overall competitiveness. To 
support this objective, a rolling program has been designed in line with the Government’s 
road sector strategy, identifying a group of subprojects that meet sound, technical, 
economic and environmental eligibility criteria. This rolling program would enable 
certain flexibility so as to allow for adjustments to be made during implementation if 
needed, exchanging subprojects that meet the same eligibility criteria as those originally 
proposed. This program includes the following activities: 
 
(a) Rehabilitation works in high priority roads along the interurban primary paved 
network, concentrated mainly on the most heavily trafficked sections that are in the 
worst condition, and rehabilitation works in primary paved roads that are connected 
to Ruta Provincial No 6, which penetrate into the Conurbano Bonaerense.    
(b) Widening provincial routes within the primary paved network that connect important 
industrial zones and ports with production and consumption centers within the 
Conurbano Bonaerense, (or selected interurban segments with high accident rates) 
and enhancing critical intersections of high traffic interurban roads through the 
construction of new roundabouts.  
(c) Rehabilitation works in the access roads to one of the main ports of the Province 
(Dock Sud) and enhancing secondary access roads to communities located near the 
primary road network.   
(d) Implementation of a well designed maintenance program for the provincial road 
network (not financed by the Bank). 
Page  3
6. 
Component 2 
–
Water and Sewerage (Total Estimated Cost: US$66.1 million of which 
U$52.3 million will be financed by Bank Loan):
 
This component would support the 
Government’s strategy of expanding water and especially sewerage coverage by 
subsidizing the access of approximately one half million low income people living in 
areas of high sanitary and/or environmental vulnerability, most of them located in the 
CB. This component will finance mostly secondary sewerage systems that take advantage 
of existing primary facilities. Primary water and/or wastewater facilities may be financed 
only under exceptional and justified situations, subject to prior approval by the Bank. In 
order for any subproject to become eligible for financing under the loan, a number of 
prior eligibility criteria both with regard to the eligibility of the operator and with regard 
to the eligibility of the subproject itself. 
 
7.  The eligibility of any operator to participate in the project rests on the following 
considerations: (a) The existence of an 
Executed Agreement
2
that ensures the provision of 
water and sewerage services in a context of economic and financial sustainability, or (in 
the case of municipal operators) the presentation to the Bank of evidence of the economic 
and financial sustainability of service provision. (b) The execution of a binding 
Framework Agreement
 between the Borrower and said Operator, on terms and conditions 
acceptable to the Bank (as indicated in Box 1 in Annex 4 and established in Schedule 5 of 
the Loan Agreement) where by the operator provides its written consent for the 
corresponding investments to be carried out within its jurisdiction, as well as a 
commitment to operate and maintain the resulting assets. 
 
8. 
The eligibility of each subproject rests on three considerations. (i) The poverty targeting 
criterion requires that subproject beneficiaries live in areas of high poverty incidence 
(defined as those where the Index of Household Material Deprivation IPMH - 
Indice de 
Privación Material de Hogares 
-
is higher than 40%, or exceptionally between 30% and 
40% up to a maximum of 15% of the investments). (ii) The technical viability criterion 
requires compliance with requisites such as connectivity to existing networks, design 
standards, and compliance with authorization processes. (iii) The environmental criteria 
entail compliance with the Bank’s environmental management criteria. 
 
9.  It is important to note that the project is based on the principle of neutrality between 
public and private operators, both of which are eligible for financing under the project as 
long as they meet the conditions stipulated above. Thus, service providers may include: 
(a) private sector concessionaires, whether at the Federal, Provincial or Municipal level; or 
(b) municipal service providers, as long as they are either incorporated (i.e. 
Sociedad 
Anónima de Capital Estatal
), administratively and financially autonomous (i.e. 
Ente 
Autárquico Municipal
)
or meet adequate criteria for
administrative and financial autonomy 
2
Executed Agreement means: (1) a binding agreement between the grantor of the pertinent water and sewerage 
concession and the relevant Operator, which agreement constitutes a renegotiation of a previously existing 
concession agreement between said parties and ensures the provision of water and sewerage services in a context of 
economic/financial sustainability of the concession, if said Operator is providing water and sewerage services under 
a
water and sewerage concession within the jurisdiction of the Guarantor; or (2) a binding agreement between the 
grantor of the pertinent water and sewerage concession and the relevant Operator, which agreement constitutes a new 
concession agreement or a renegotiation (
readecuación
)
of a previously existing concession agreement between said 
parties either of which ensures the provision of water and sewerage services in a context of economic/financial 
sustainability of the concession, if said Operator is or will be providing water and sewerage services under a water 
and sewerage concession within the jurisdiction of the Borrower or within the jurisdi
ction of any of the Borrower’s 
municipalities. 
Page  4
(namely, full accounting and revenue separation from the municipality, as well as direct 
control over personnel). There are about 180 operators that could potentially participate in 
the project, including 150 municipal utilities (cooperatives and concessions) and two 
provincial concessions, together with AASA at the federal level.  
 
10. Nevertheless, the federal concession as well as the two provincial concessions, are all 
currently in the process of renegotiating their contracts with the respective authorities. 
They will therefore not be eligible to participate in the project until this process is 
completed and a new framework for economic and financial sustainability is established. 
At the provincial level, the renegotiation process is progressing, with the recent 
conclusion of the renegotiation process with the electricity concessionaire. The 
renegotiation process for the water concessions is expected to be completed on schedule, 
i.e. by December 31, 2004. At the federal level, a provisional one-year agreement has 
been signed but a definitive agreement may take longer to be reached. In both cases, it is 
anticipated that the possibility of accessing finance under the project will act as a positive 
incentive for concluding the renegotiation process.
 
11. Currently the stock of identified water and sewerage subprojects that have been 
satisfactorily evaluated during preparation and found to meet the technical and poverty 
eligibility criteria amounts to US$126 million, almost doubling the amount allocated to 
this component.  Within this stock of projects totaling US$126 million, there are eligible 
subprojects totaling $19 million from utilities not subject to renegotiation.  The remaining 
US$107 million includes eligible subprojects from utilities subject to provincial 
renegotiations (US$67 million) or from the federal concession (US$40 million).  These 
subprojects cannot be financed under the proposed project until all eligibility criteria, 
including the completion of the renegotiation of the concession agreements, have been 
met. The Government expects to conclude the provincial renegotiation process soon and 
therefore requested that the proposed project include funding for water and sewerage 
subprojects so as to ensure a quick start of their execution as soon as the eligibility 
criteria have been met. In case that said subprojects do not become eligible, subprojects 
from the road component currently scheduled for APL2 could be advanced to take 
advantage of the unused funds. With regard to the works to be covered in areas served by 
providers under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, negotiations between the 
involved parties are on-going and it is expected that works will be covered under APL2.
 
12. In addition to the above implementation risk, there is a regulatory risk due to: (i) the 
continuation of the existing emergency provisions that among other things have frozen 
the tariffs since 2002; and (ii) the potential enactment of the Proposed Public Service and 
Infrastructure Regulatory Framework Law. Both the potential extension of the emergency 
provisions beyond December 2004 and the eventual new law may affect the water and 
sewerage service concessions in the Province. The extension of the emergency provisions 
and the enactment of a new Law could affect service providers even if these fall under the 
Provincial Regulatory Framework, since the Province may adhere to the Federal Law. 
Developments in this area would be closely monitored by staff and evaluated on their 
potential effect on the proposed Project   
 
13. 
Component 3 
–
Drainage (Estimated Cost US$14.3 million of which US$11.3 million 
will be financed by Bank Loan):
 This component will finance a series of storm sewers in 
five urban and periurban areas of the CB to mitigate flooding caused by rainfalls of high 
intensity and relatively short duration, which cause significant losses to households, 
Page  5
especially low income people, to industries and to commercial activities, both directly 
and indirectly, due to the interruption of transport and other services.
 
14. 
Component 4 
–
Technical Assistance (Estimated Cost US$14.8 million of which 
US$11.7 million will be financed by Bank Loan): 
In line with the development 
objectives, a technical assistance component has been prepared to support the design and 
implementation of measures required both in the short and long run to reestablish the 
institutional capacity in the Province required: (i) to implement the proposed 
infrastructure Program, strengthening the execution capacity of the involved agencies; 
and (ii) to support the strategic planning capacities of the Province to foster 
competitiveness and employment.  In line with these objectives, the component is divided 
into two sub components:  
 
(a) An 
institutional strengthening
 sub-component to: (i) support capacity-building 
measures in those entities directly involved in the execution of work 
subprojects (DPV, DIPSOH) or indirectly (Secretariat of Environmental 
Policy, Provincial Statistics Unit); (ii) strengthen provincial infrastructure 
planning functions; (iii) enhance regulatory capacity in the provision of public 
services; and (iv) generate better information systems to guide decision 
making through the creation of a provincial geo-referenced information 
system and supporting the digitalization of cadastral information.  
(b) A 
pre-investment sub-component
 
for competitiveness and job generation
 
aimed to: (i) define a strategic framework to orient provincial development, 
(ii) identify sectors and regions likely to play a key role in provincial 
development; (iii) design a series of sector and territorial 
interventions/policies aimed at improving competitiveness and employment 
opportunities; (iv) identify infrastructure needs and set strategic priorities in 
order to avoid infrastructure bottlenecks; and (vi) adjust budget formulation 
and execution to a spatially organized and multiyear framework.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.  
 
Works included in the Project will not cause significant environmental impacts.  
However, an Environmental Assessment has been carried out to include in project 
implementation measures to prevent, mitigate and/or compensate any potential impacts. 
No mayor threat to natural habitat and/or resettlements is expected.
 
Cultural Property
:
According to the new guidelines, all infrastructure projects should trigger the cultural 
property policy.  Given this, even though there is no expectation that cultural property is in the Project area, 
the Environmental Assessment sets forth "chance find" procedures in the case that such property is 
encountered. 
 
International Waterways
:
The Quality Assurance Team agreed that the project falls under 
the exception to the notification requirement mentioned in paragraph 7 of OP 7.50. 
However and in accordance with the provisions of the referred OP, Bank staff, in 
consultation with the Borrower and the Guarantor examined the application of the River 
Plate Treaty (Tratado del Rio de la Plata) to the present case.   The Guarantor and the 
Borrower agreed that the works to be carried out under the Water and Sewerage and 
Drainage components would have no impact on the navigability and/or the course 
(regime) of the
 Río de la Plata
.
Consequently, both, the Guarantor and the Borrower 
concurred that based on the nature of the works under the Project the notification 
requirement to the 
Comisión Administradora del Río de la Plata
 was not applicable.    
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area.  
 
No indirect or long-term impacts are expected to occur.
 
The impacts that could be 
generated by the execution of works are direct and contingent (transportation of 
materials, the exploitation of bordering territory, the final disposition of waste material, 
the location of camping and asphalt plants, road safety during construction of works, 
among others).   
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Is not relevant 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Socio-environmental evaluations were carried out for projects included in the first year 
program
.
The 
Guide for Rapid Environmental and Social Evaluation of Road Projects
 
developed by the Quality Assurance Team of the Bank (QAT), were used in the 
environmental evaluations of sub-projects under the road component. A Strategic 
Environmental Evaluation (SEE) for the urban sewerage subcomponent was developed 
during the preparation phase of the project, in order to ensure the introduction of the 
environmental and social dimension, defining polic
ies, procedures and plans that will 
Page  8
strengthen the environmental and social management in the design, execution and 
monitoring of projects. The five urban drainage subprojects were also satisfactorily 
evaluated. The environmental assessment sets forth "chance find" procedures in the case 
that cultural property is encountered. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Consultation with the main beneficiaries and stakeholders were conducted during project 
preparation.
