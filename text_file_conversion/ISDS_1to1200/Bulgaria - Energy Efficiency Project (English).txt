B.  Project Objective 
 
The objective of the proposed project is to support a large increase in energy efficiency (EE) investment in Bulgaria 
through development of a self-sustaining, market-based financing mechanism.  The project is focused on the 
development and implementation of financially profitable EE projects, which can provide sustainable and increasing 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions without relying on public subsidy. 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
The proposed project would support the establishment and operation of the Bulgarian Energy 
Efficiency Fund (BEEF) in a public-private partnership.  BEEF would combine both technical 
project development capacity and financial structuring capacity into one entity, thereby 
addressing the current weak capacity to develop bankable EE projects.  It  would be designed to 
be flexible, offering financial products demanded by the evolving EE finance market.  It is 
expected that the BEEF would consist of three components: 
  
\01\02
Partial Credit Guarantees: to share in the credit risk of EE finance transactions.  
\01\02
Loan Financing: to co-finance bankable EE projects on a profit-oriented commercial 
lending basis. 
\01\02
Technical Assistance: to initially finance on a grant basis a portion of EE project 
development and administration costs of the BEEF. 
Designed as a demand-driven facility, BEEF would make available both loans and partial credit 
guarantees for EE projects.  The Fund manager is expected to make rational choices about the 
appropriate financing tool based on specific project circumstances and overall project portfolio 
management considerations. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Page  2
 
 
 
The subprojects supported by BEEF will be implemented country-wide in the Republic of Bulgaria. Geographic 
location, information about key environmental and social characteristics of the area, and population likely to be 
affected, proximity to protected areas, etc., will be dealt with in the process of environmental assessment of the 
individual subprojects. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity 
 
The Project will be implemented by the Ministry of Energy and Energy Resources (MEER), which has  experience 
in implementing projects supported by international donor agencies – particularly in the context of the EU PHARE 
program.  A well-staffed Project Preparation Unit was established within MEER.

A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues and prepare to 
mitigate them? 
The BEEF Operations Manual (OM) will include an environmental chapter which will describe the steps to be taken 
by the Fund Manager in order to comply with national environmental regulations and Bank policy on Environmental 
Assessment for all subprojects financed/guranteed under the BEEF. 
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed? 
Under the Project, it will be required that the Bank’s standard procedure for public consultation and disclosure be 
applied.  
 
IV.  AGREEMENTS REACHED ON SAFEGUARDS AT PCN 
REVIEW 
It was agreed that the environmental category FI and safeguards category SF are appropriate.  An environmental 
chapter of the OM will be prepared describing the procedures and arrangements to assure subprojects compliance 
with the national environmental regulations and Bank policy on Environmental Assessment.  The environmental 
chapter of the OM will be sent to ECSSD for review and disclosed in the country (in local language) and at the 
Bank's Infoshop (English version) prior to project appraisal.  
 
No land acquisition is expected in the sub-projects to be supported by BEEF.  
 
Agreed target date for Quality Enhancement Review:
