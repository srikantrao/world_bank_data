    3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

    The Loan 8746-IN for Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Project (MPUDP), in the amount of US$166 million was
    approved on April 12, 2017 and became effective on July 12, 2017. The original closing date of the Credit Agreement is
    December 31, 2022.
    The project development objective (PDO) is to enhance the capacity of the Madhya Pradesh Urban Development
    Company (MPUDC) to improve coverage of key urban services and increase the revenue of participating urban local
    bodies (ULBs).
    The project has two components: (i) Component 1: Institutional Development (US$26.5 million; Bank loan US$18.6
    million) will strengthen urban policy reforms linked to implementation and sustainability of municipal investments
    being taken up through the Project, and undertake institutional strengthening of MPUDC as the nodal executing
    agency set-up with the mandate of improving provision of municipal services in the state of Madhya Pradesh in
    partnership and on behalf of ULBs; and (ii) Component 2: Urban Investments (US$139.2 million; Bank loan 97.4
    million) will finance infrastructure sub-projects in participating ULBs to improve provision of a range of urban services,
    including water supply, sewerage and septage management, drainage, and solid waste management.

    4. PROJECT LOCATION AND SALIENT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS RELEVANT TO THE SAFEGUARD ANALYSIS (IF
       KNOWN)
    Madhya Pradesh (MP) is the second largest, fifth populous, and eighth most urbanized state in India.
    Although MP recorded a higher rate of urbanization compared to rural growth in the last decade, its
    urbanization rate is still below the national average but it is projected to catch-up in the next 15 years. At
    present, MP total urban population is of 20.1 million (28% of total population) concentrated in 476 urban
    centers as follows: Of the 14 municipal corporations, four (Indore, Bhopal, Jabalpur, and Gwalior) are million-
    plus cities. Access to water and sanitation is the biggest challenge for the urban population particularly the
    poor. Slum population is about 6. 4 million as per Census of India 2011. While the institutional development
    component (Component 1) of MPUDP supports ULBs across the state, the urban investment component
    (Component 2) proposes to support development of water supply projects in 7 cities and sewerage
    infrastructure in about 18 cities of the state. Three sub-projects in Khargaon, Burhanpur (water supply) and
    Chhindwara (Sewerage) will be implemented in the first year and sub-projects in the remaining cities are
    being developed for implementation in the subsequent years. Based on the environmental and social
    assessments carried out for first three sub-projects and screening of remaining project cities indicate that the
    water supply sub-projects involve sensitive water bodies such as River Tapti in Burhanpur, River Chambal in
    Morena, River Narmada, etc. and construction of intake structure in Crocodile Sanctuary in River Chambal for
    Morena water supply for project. Number of historic and religious structures are also located in many of the
    cities, which requires careful planning and implementation of project activities. In addition, the proposed
    project will also have positive environmental and social impacts owing to benefits such as improved water

supply, sanitation, wastewater management, in the project cities. The benefits are likely to be, in the form of
saving time for collection of water, improved health and personal hygiene and improved quality of life. On
the other hand, the project may also have some adverse social impacts related to displacement of people,
especially the non- title holders and also involve some private land for the proposed infrastructure
improvement interventions. In Madhya Pradesh, the tribal population in urban areas is 14.5 percent(census
2011) and scattered all over the State. Some of the project Towns fall in the Scheduled V areas. However, the
tribal people in urban areas do not explicit typical characteristics such as living as a group; speak separate
language from dominant population, having separate institutions in close attachment to the forest etc.

II. KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT

 A.     SUMMARY OF KEY SAFEGUARD ISSUES


 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any
      potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
      Environmental Safeguard Issues:
      Some of the sub-projects activities, especially intake structures for water supply projects are located on
      environmentally sensitive locations such as River Tapti in Burhanpur, River Chambal in Morena and River Kunda
      (tributary of River Narmada) in Khargone, etc. These sub-projects are likely to cause significant water quality impacts
      during construction and the River Ecology during operation phase. In addition, the intake structure for water supply
      project in Morena city is likely to impact the Crocodile Sanctuary in River Chambal, both during construction and
      operation phase. A number of religious and historic monuments are located in many of the 25 project cities identified
      for potential sub-projects. Detailed design and implementation of the sub-projects in these cities would require
      careful finalization of designs and execution during the construction phase of the respective sub-projects. Considering
      the urban nature of the project cities, impacts such as construction site management, safety of neighboring
      communities and construction workers, impacts on various utilities, temporary traffic diversions, temporary air and
      noise impacts are also expected during construction phase of the sub-projects. The environmental and social
      assessments carried out for the three first year sub-projects assesses the impacts in the respective sub-project and
      includes specific EMP to address these impacts. In addition, the ESMF prepared for MPUDP provides for carrying out
      environmental assessments to address all the environmental impacts of the sub-projects and development of specific
      environmental management plans. All sub-project ESAs will be shared with the Bank for review and clearance.

      Social Issues:
      No large scale land acquisition or R&R is expected under the project so far. All the sub projects shall be subjected to
      screening for impacts. All Sub projects RAPs and IPPs shall be shared with World Bank for necessary review and
      clearance. The ESAs for the first three sub projects do not require any land acquisition or permanent displacement.
      The temporary loss to income and any damage to roadside properties identified during excavation works and laying
      of pipes shall be compensated/restored as per ESMP.



 2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
      Environmental Impacts:
      The indirect environmental impacts of MPUDP sub-projects could include increased generation of wastewater in cities
      where water supply sub-projects are implemented. The other indirect impacts of the project, include discharge of
      partially treated wastewater from the treatment plants and /or improper maintenance of wastewater infrastructure.
       The World Bank                                                                                 RESTRUCTURING ISDS
       Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Project (P155303)



  Indirect impacts are also expected due to the inadequate operation and maintenance of water treatment plants,
  pumping stations, booster stations and water/wastewater network In order to address these impacts, action plans
  will be agreed with the respective project cities during the sub-project preparation, to ensure treatment and disposal
  of increased wastewater generated in the project cities. Similarly, clear O&M plans and budgets will also be agreed
  with the respective project cities during the preparation of wastewater sub-projects. These principles have been
  incorporated in the ESMF for the MPUDP, to ensure the implementation by MPUDC.

  Social Impacts:
  Improved water supply and sanitation in the participating cities shall result in positive benefits in the long term.


3. Describe any potential alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
  While the provision of urban infrastructure and improving service levels is the primary objective of MPUDP, the
  principle of alternatives has been embedded in the ESMF developed for the project. Each sub-project during the
  design phase will analyze alternatives for locating various facilities such as treatment plans, pumping stations for the
  sub-projects and also in finalizing alignment of transmission lines and distribution networks. These have been
  analyzed in the three sub-projects that have been appraised for the implementation in the first year of the project. In
  case of Khargaon water supply project, based on the analysis of alternatives, the existing water treatment plant is
  being refurbished, so that the capacity of new treatment plant is optimized. Similarly, in Chhindwara Sewerage sub-
  project, centralized sewerage system for the main city and decentralized sewerage system peripheral areas is being
  proposed. Similar approach will be followed for other sub-projects that will be developed in future.


4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower
  capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
  MPUDP is likely to implement sub-projects, which could involve complex environmental issues such as avoiding
  impacts on crocodile sanctuary, historic and religious structures and construction safety issues in densely populated
  urban areas. The sub projects could also involve some land acquisition, damage to roadside structures and loss of
  income. MPUDC with its Project Implementation Units (PIU) at various parts of the state, will be responsible for the
  preparation of sub project specific safeguard management plans and its implementation. The Project Management
  Unit (PMU) at MPUDC headquarters supported by a team of Project Management Consultants (PMC) will be
  monitoring the implementation of sub-projects. All these agencies (PMU, PMC and PIU) will be staffed qualified
  environmental engineers / specialists and social scientists/specialists to ensure implementation of safeguard
  management plans. Their capacity will be strengthened with regular training and orientation programs during
  implementation. While a dedicated environmental engineer and social specialists are already on board, the safeguard
  specialists for the PMC and at the PIUs will be on board prior to negotiations for MPUDP.

  In addition to the above institutional arrangements, the borrower has prepared an ESMF for the project and have
  also prepared Environmental and Social Assessments (ESAs) for the three sub-projects (Burhanpur, Khargaon water
  supply and Chhindwara sewerage), which have been reviewed and cleared by the Bank. These ESAS will be verified
  based on the final design of the Design Review, Build and Operate (DRBO) Contractor and the respective ESMPs will
  be updated to address the impacts due to the design changes (if any). In addition to addressing the issues that may
  arise from various urban investment sub-projects, the ESMF will also be applicable for all the technical assistance
  activities that will be undertaken through MPUDP.


5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanism for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with
  an emphasis on potentially affected people.
