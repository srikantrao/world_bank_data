B.  Project Objectives.  
The overall development objective of the project is to improve the quality, 
economic relevance, and equity of secondary education to support lifelong learning. 
 
There are two key outcome indicators: 
·
Secondary school graduates from schools receiving new curriculum and related support via the proposed 
Secondary Education Project will have improved performance, as measured by scores on national and 
international assessments and graduate tracer studies, than those from schools not receiving project 
support. 
·
Secondary schools receiving new curriculum and related support via the proposed Secondary Education 
Project will have a reduced variance in student achievement between schools in different regions, 
between general and vocational schools. 
 
C.  Project Description.  
There are two major project components, with six inter-related sub-components.  
The objectives are as follows (more details on sub-objectives are contained in Annex IV, and the Project 
Operational Manual  contains detailed activities for each sub-objective). 
 
Component 1. 
Secondary Education Reform
 
Secondary Education Programs
.
The objective is to revise and implement new general education and 
vocational education curriculum programs to provide students with core skills for the knowledge economy 
and lifelong learning.  The project would finance technical assistance, equipment and materials to strengthen 
the institutional structures, develop technical procedures and new curricular content, implement revised 
general education and vocational education curriculum programs, and provide related in-service training for 
MONE managers and teachers. 
Information and Communications Technology (ICT).
The objective is to provide ICT training as a core 
competency for youth to function in a modern knowledge economy, to improve instruction by using ICT to 
Page  2
expand access to learning opportunities, and to support better management of learning and administrative 
processes.  The project would finance technical assistance, goods and materials to utilize ICT to improve 
instruction, access on-line educational content and services on the Internet, and assess the educational impact 
of the ICT investments. 
Career Guidance and Counseling
:
The objective is to provide youth and adults with access to career 
information and guidance services to promote informed career choices and related education and training 
decisions and facilitate lifelong learning. The project would finance technical assistance, equipment, and 
materials to facilitate interagency cooperation, develop core career information and guidance resources and 
provide them to education and labor institutions, train existing staff and improve preservice training for 
career guidance and improve the integration of career guidance and counseling into overall basic and 
secondary education programs. 
Component 2: Quality, Assessment, and Management 
Student Assessment and Evaluation.
The objective is to improve the quality and outcomes of secondary 
education by developing systems to collect and disseminate reliable information on student learning and 
outcomes, and on the performance of the education system staff and institutions, and to use information from 
these assessments to improve system performance and student outcomes. 
 
School Development. 
The objective is to help secondary schools staff, parents, and students improve the 
performance and outcomes, educational achievement, and quality in education through school development 
activities to be designed and implemented within the school development process. 
Project Management.
The objective is to ensure effective administration and coordination of the overall 
project. The project would finance related technical assistance, equipment, and materials. 
D.  Project location
.
The Ministry of National Education (MONE) is responsible for overall management 
of the project, has designate specific departments to administer selected components, and will coordinate 
with the Higher Education Council (YOK) to administer the post secondary component. Draft criteria for 
selection of individual schools to receive project resources have been development by the implementing 
agency with Bank staff, and will be finalized during the appraisal mission.
