A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The main objective is to overcome barriers to the update of biomass technologies by providing 
examples of best practice (demonstration plants) in the use of biomass fuelled energy systems as a 
viable alternative to gas, oil and coal and as a sustainable means of addressing the energy supply 
problems facing rural communities and agro-enterprises. Demonstration systems would be of a size, 
scale and cost appropriate for wide replication in rural areas. This would be supported by access to 
information, technical support and a fund to cover the incremental capital cost in installation of 
biomass-fuelled systems. 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project will provide a foundation for a broad and efficient use of biomass in substitution for 
imported fossil fuels (coal), acting as a catalyst for the introduction and promotion of the use of 
primary agricultural wastes (biomass) to fuel energy generation using efficient technologies. This will 
(i) reduce greenhouse emissions by replacing fossil fuels and simultaneously reduce environmental 
pollution from unwanted biomass otherwise
being burnt in the fields; (ii) improve energy efficiency in 
Page  2
heating systems; (iii) introduce renewable energy from local sources substituting carbon neutral 
biomass for fossil fuels; (iv) recycle ash residues as a fertilizer; (v) generate the possibility for new 
income streams for rural population, and (vi) provide social and economic community benefits. 
 
Component A: Biomass  Energy Demonstration Units  
The component objective is installation of demonstration sites in rural communities along with the 
integrated and relevant support to new thermal energy heating units, including provision of equipment 
for installing a complete biomass heating systems on sites, training to the beneficiaries on maintenance, 
demonstration of systems’ operation to more than 500 potential future users. 
Component B: Biomass production and fuel cycle support  
The component objective is to assist in establishment of full biomass chain supply, who would 
contribute with their own land, labor and machinery, but also receive a partial grant support from the 
project to motivate and compensate for the new market start up risks, to transfigure biomass 
agricultural wastes, often lost, into a sustainable market product and a suitable thermal energy raw 
material. 
Component C: Public awareness, outreach and dissemination, information barriers removal 
The objective of the component is to provide a full range of measures, including an intensive 
information campaign throughout local mass-media, an important number of regional and site 
workshops, seminars, panel discussions, a telephone “hot-line”, etc., in order to get a 15% increase in 
awareness of rural population, regarding usage of renewable energy and biomass in the country.
 
Component D: Project Management, audit, monitoring and evaluation activities 
The component will provide support for day-to-day project management, including planning and 
division of tasks, book-keeping, disbursement and reporting, procurement, budgeting and performance 
analysis; direct and indirect monitoring and evaluations of the process indicators and outcome 
indicators, including global and local impact of the project. This will also include the independent 
audit of the project accounts and financial reports. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The Republic of Moldova is a landlocked, country of 33,840 square km, located in the Southeastern 
part of Europe. The Republic is divided into 33 administrative regions plus the municipality of 
Chisinau, the autonomous Gagauz region and the Transdneister territory (a self proclaimed 
Transnistrian Moldavian Republic). 
In 2002 over 40% of the population lived below the absolute poverty threshold. Poverty has generated a 
range of social problems, including an exodus of 35-40% of the economically active population abroad. 
Despite some improvement during the last three years, GDP per capita (US$542 in 2003), continues to 
be the last but one among the ex-soviet countries, and the last among the countries of Central and 
South-Eastern Europe. 
Agriculture is the mainstay of the Moldovan economy, accounting for about 25 percent of GDP, 40 
percent of employment and 65 percent of exports, which includes agro-processing exports
1
.
Poverty is 
most severe in rural areas, where 54 percent of the population lives and rural poverty accounting for 68 
percent of total poverty. 
 
In 1990 carbon dioxide emissions amounted to 28,323Gg, dropping to 12,086Gg in 1994 and to 23% 
of base year emissions by 1998. Total greenhouse gas emissions, in tons of CO
2
equivalent amounted 
to 33,273Gg in 1990 and 10,621Gg in 1998, or in per capita terms, 7.6 tons in 1990 and 2.5tons in 
1998.

O) expressed in tCO2e, shows a 
relative decrease in carbon dioxide and an increase in methane emissions. The main sources of air 
pollution are heat and power plants (35-40%), residential heating systems, motor transport and 
industrial activity. There are 9 zones of increased pollution representing the main urban and industrial 
zones (Chisinau, Bender, Cahul, Ribnita, Soroca, Balt, Edinet, Tiraspol and Rezina) as increases in 
pollution run in parallel to economic activity and the use of coal, oil and methane. The most widely 
used energy source in rural areas is coal.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project has been placed in environmental screening category B under the provisions of the 
World bank’s Operational Policy 4.01, “Environmental Assessment” and in safeguards 
classification category S2. Project will support the promotion of biomass use for production of 
thermal energy in Moldova as a viable, cost-effective alternative to gas, oil and coal, by using 
“examples of best practice” such as efficient technologies and demonstration sites. Through this 
approach, the project is expected to make a positive environmental impact through reduction of 
the pollution from additional biomass, mostly cereal’s straws that usually remain burned and 
therefore unused on the fields. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area. 
 
The project is expected to support positive long term environmental effects.  The conclusions of 
the environmental assessment were that Project will result in three main environmental benefits, 
by: 
i.) 
Diminishing the carbon release that takes place from the use of any fossil fuels;  
ii.) 
Decreasing air pollution by both reducing the field burning of unwanted biomass (straw) 
reducing consequent soil damage; 
iii.) 
Reducing soil and water pollution as a result of fuel switching from biomass from coal; 
 
The primary adverse impacts from the project are largely associated with small-scale civil works 
for infrastructure improvements. These impacts are very localized (predominantly in urban areas), 
limited in their scope, short in duration and can be addressed through both design and monitoring 
measures. 
 
The conclusion is that the demonstration sites will stimulate the use of renewable energy 
(biomass) biomass technology as it is probable that there will be wide support from local public 
authorities. A Simple Management Plan outlines measures to diminish and prevent probable 
impacts of Project and includes an Impacts Monitoring Plan. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment 
of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The borrower has prepared and formally adopted an Environmental Mitigation Plan. The EMP 
summarizes the recommended impact mitigation measures and monitoring actions to minimize 
and/or avoid the limited potential short and long-term impacts of activities under project-
supported investments. The EMP identifies potential environmental impacts related to 
construction and / or improvement of water supply and sewerage systems, drinking water 
improvement and wastewater treatment facilities, solid waste handling and disposal.  These 
potential impacts and their associated mitigation and monitoring actions are summarized below 
and described in greater detail in the EMP. The key mitigation measures included in the project 
are:
a) 
To assess engineering state of 
heating
-
house building in Chiscareni Village and provide 
Page  5
necessary measures if necessary taking into account 7-point earthquake zone of the village; b) To 
organize mutually beneficial and correct system of applying the straw-ash fertilizers accompanied 
as possible with organic fertilizing; to take measures for beneficial selling of straw-ash with 
normative benefit-sharing to support soil fecundity in involved territories. 
 
The above would include, but not limited to: 
 
Impact Mitigation Measures 
 
A.  Foolproof removal and temporal storage of straw ashes would decrease probable danger 
of dust pollution in settlements. 
 
B. Planting of gre
enery on the “Ecoplantera” area would be appropriate in order to 
compensate some increase of flying pollutants due to substitution of gas-burning by 
straw-burning heating system. 
 
C.  Removal of straw from fields causes loss of potential soil organic matter (despite usually 
nobody plough straw in soil) and takes away such nutritive elements as phosphorus, 
potassium, magnesium and removal of calcium may change sometimes PH of soil. The 
problem may be solved through use of ash for fertilizing and applying of other fertilizers. 
Additional expenses for that may be assessed as 7 UDS per one tone of straw and not exceed 
10 % of straw cost. 
 
D.  Problem of straw storage may be mitigated through contracts for gradual supply by straw 
using small depot to provide stability of supply.  
 
Impacts Monitoring Plan 
 
E.  It is necessary to establish regular monitoring of straw combustion efficiency (not less 
than 80%) to control exceeding the normative emissions and support economical 
efficiency. 
 
F. 
Control of planting of greenery in the “Ecoplantera” area has to be done (fact of planting, 
effective ratio of alive plants to the end of spring, safety of plantation) targeting to soften 
some increase of CO and other pollution.  
 
G.  That is a measure to exclude damage of human health to control regularly (i) sanitary 
state of heating-house, (ii) equipment and (iii) safety measures for heating-house 
personnel. The last matter is directed to avoid damage of their health from dust of straw 
trash because of cellulose inhalation-connected diseases and probable allergy. 
 
H.  It is very important to control strongly state of indoor temporal ash-straw depot and to 
prevent formation of straw-ash depot outdoor that would cause air, soil and water 
pollution. 
 
EMP will be regularly updated as more specific projects in participating towns are identified. 
 
Borrower Capacity 
 
Starting from  1992, Moldovan authorities have developed a series of new laws and regulations 
which stipulate in detail all aspects of the EIA procedure as follows:  
Page  6
·
Law on Environmental Protection (1993); 
·
Law on State Environmental Expertise (SEE) and Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) (1996); 
·
Law on Industrial Safety (2000); 
·
Guidelines on Performing State Environmental Expertise (1995); 
·
Regulation on Joint Expert Committee of the Ministry of Environment (1998); 
·
Regulation on Public Participation in Environmental Decision-Making (2000). 
 
The competent SEE authority
 
in Moldova is the Division on SEE within the State Ecological 
Inspectorate, a subdivision of the Ministry of Ecology, Construction and Territorial Development. 
It incorporates dual functions. As the main administrative body, it is responsible for organizing 
and coordinating the SEE procedure (Law on SEE and EIA, Article 7(2)). As the expert body, it 
is responsible for reviewing project documentation for planned activities and deciding whether or 
not they may be implemented.  In the latter function, the ministry is represented by a group of 
permanently employed state experts of the Division on SEE. All aspects of the environment are 
represented, 
e.g.,
 atmosphere, soil, flora and fauna, 
etc
.
According to the Law on SEE and EIA, 
these experts should be highly trained professionals with at least 10 years of experience in the 
field and five years as planners (Article 7(3)).  The Division on SEE is also responsible for 
control and supervision of SEE procedures. National-level developments; new policies, programs, 
and plans; and new laws and regulations are reviewed by the experts of the Ministry of Ecology, 
Construction and Territorial Development.   
 
Consolidated Agricultural Project Implementation Unit (CAPMU) has sufficient experience in 
safeguard related issues, as have been directly involved in preparation and implementation of a 
number of World Bank projects, mainly in rural areas, including Rural Investment and Services 
Project, and Organic Pollution Prevention Project, funded by GEF, which also included 
safeguards training to the CAPMU staff. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The Inter-Agency and Public/NGO Consultation Process concludes that the Biomass Project will 
primarily impact on the local public authorities, which have the main responsibility for the 
operation of public buildings. Indirect impact will relate to the Ministry of Education, local health 
and environmental authorities, regional departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
Industry and local agricultural producers. 
 
Biomass Project does not create wide effects for state agencies. Local public authorities that bring 
main responsibility for operation of social objects are the main real stakeholders.  
 
Being in spirit of legislation the simple information about project in implementation localities 
would substitute public consultation process; it may be done through local authorities and NGOs 
if they exist. 
 
Environmental Assessment and the Simple Environmental Management plan were the topic of 
discussions and disseminations beginning with regional workshops and ending with the national 
one in Chisinau, as follows: 
 
1. January 24, 2005, Antonesti village, the district of Stefan Voda -the Center of the country 
2. January 28, 2005, Chiscareni village, district of Singerei - the North part of the country 
Page  7
3. February 3, 2005, Taraclia village, district of Causeni - the south part of the country 
4. February 11, 2005, Chisinau the Capital of Moldova - national wide workshop   
 
The Ministry of Ecology and Emergency Situations also participated in reviewing the EMP 
during project preparation and in the finalization of the documentation toward the end of project 
preparation.  A letter giving a positive assessment of the draft EMP from the Ministry’s 
Department of Ecology and Nature Management on August 12, 2004.
