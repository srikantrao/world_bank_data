A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The key development objectives of the Airports Development Project, which are closely interrelated, are to: 
 
\01fi
eliminate capacity bottlenecks to traffic growth, particularly that of tourists and associated foreign 
exchange earnings; 
\01fi
raise Cairo International Airport (CAI) and Sharm El Sheikh Airport (SSH) service quality at 
international best practice standards; and 
\01fi
promote efficient private participation in airport management and airport service delivery in a 
more competitive market.   
 
The project would also contribute to three of the Government’s higher level objectives: 
 
\01fi
Employment generation
.  Although direct employment is not expected to rise given the 
current level of excess staffing (around 2,150 passengers per staff for Cairo Airport 
Company), indirect employment opportunities would be created with the project through 
expanding airport traffic. 
\01fi
Increasing foreign exchange earnings
.  Tourism is one of Egypt’s largest producers of foreign 
exchange.  International tourism injected the equivalent of US$4.3 billion into the economy in 
2000, or an average of US$780 per tourist, which was up from US$3.0 billion in 1996.  Most 
tourists come from overseas and airports are their primary points of entry. 
\01fi
Developing agricultural exports
.  Air cargo traffic has been concentrated on CAI and 
saturated capacities there combined with operational inefficiencies help explain a good part of 
the stagnated growth.  Tthe reorganization and development of air cargo facilities at CAI 
under a management contract will be implemented by the GOE.  Capacity bottlenecks to 
cargo expansion will be removed and agriculture production and employment given a boost.

A.3. Project Description 
 
The scope of the proposed Airports Development Project (ADP) includes constructing new terminals at 
Cairo International Airport and Sharm El Sheikh Airport, which upon completion will be managed by 
private operators, and technical assistance to support gradual liberalization of the sector.  The Project’s 
overall cost is estimated to be US$561.3 million. 
 
Component 1, the new TB3 terminal, will consist of: (i) one new terminal building; (ii) one concourse; (iii) 
two fingers; (iv) three skyways - two connecting the concourse with each finger, and one connecting 
Terminal 2 with TB3; and (v) electromechanical systems and equipment.  The new terminal will consist of 
three levels and have a built-up area of 164,000 square meters. 
 
Component 2, the new terminal building at Sharm El Sheikh Airport, will consist of: (i) one new terminal 
building; and (ii) electromechanical systems and equipment.  Upon completion, both terminals will be 
managed by private operators. 
 
Component 3, Technical Assistance, consists of support to: (i) prepare a national airport master plan; (ii) 
develop a plan to gradually liberalize air transport in Egypt; (iii) devise a strategy for developing air cargo; 
(iv) establish Environmental Units at the Cairo Airport Company (CAC) and the Egyptian Airport 
Company (EAC); and (v) strengthen airport management capacity. 
 
A.4. Project Location and Salient Physical Characteristics Relevant to the Safeguard Analysis 
 
The Project’s two largest components, the development of new airport terminals, will be in Cairo, Egypt, a 
city of twelve million inhabitants, and Sharm El Sheikh, a small city located on the southern tip of the Sinai 
Peninsula.  Cairo International Airport is Egypt’s main international gateway and receives more than half 
of all passenger traffic.  Sharm is a thriving tourist resort with around forty hotels and some 30,000 rooms.  
The Project is not expected to have any adverse environmental or social impacts.  The land on which the 
two terminals will be developed is fenced, in the public domain, and other than airport activities, is 
unoccupied.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Within the framework of the Environmental Assessments (EA), which were conducted in accordance with 
OP/BP 4.01, two concise and distinct Social Assessments (SoA) were undertaken, as were stakeholder 
consultations, for the third terminal at CAI and the new terminal at SSH.  The objective of the SoAs was to 
identify the various stakeholders, draw their socioeconomic profile, and collect information on their 
perceptions of the project.  The results show that overall, respondents have a positive opinion of the project, 
and acknowledge the value added, particularly from increased business and improved infrastructure and 
services.  However, concerns were registered over some environmental impacts, such as an anticipated 
increase in noise and traffic congestion. 
 
Three Land Acquisition Assessments (LAA) were also prepared for the project (two for TB3 and one for 
SSH).  The results show that the sites designated for the construction of a third terminal and an additional 
runway at CAI are state owned, have been fenced for the last twenty years, and legally transferred to the 
CAC. The future site of the third terminal is presently used for public parking, and provisions are being 
made to provide an alternative parking site.  The site for an additional runway is not used or leased for any 
economic activity.  Both sites are located within CAC’s overall property and are free of claims. 
 
The LAA for the new terminal at SSH revealed that the land is state property legally transferred to the 
EAC.  It is fenced, adjacent to the existing terminal, and surrounded by more land belonging to the EAC.  
Presently, the land is not used for any economic activity and there are no claims on it.  As such, OP/BP 
4.12 related to Involuntary Resettlement will not be triggered for any of the proposed sites. 
 
OD 4.20 and OP 4.11 related to indigenous peoples and cultural property are not applicable, as both sites 
are uninhabited and are not known to have archeological or cultural value. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area. 
 
Noise would likely have the biggest long-term impact.  Other potential impacts, such as waste management 
and treatment of any hazardous materials, could more easily be mitigated.  The development of a third 
terminal at CAI and a new terminal at SSH should generate a number of nominal benefits, including 
additional job opportunities, improved waste management, and implementation of noise and air quality 
monitoring programs. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
The EIAs examined, in a manner acceptable to the Bank, project alternatives and identified the main 
impacts resulting from the socio-economic, biological and physical environment.  Scoping sessions and 
public consultations were also conducted during the different phases of EA preparation.  Expected impacts, 
mitigating measures, costs of implementing mitigation measures, responsibility for financing and 
implementing measures, and for monitoring arrangements during the pre-construction, construction, and 
operational phases are defined and documented in detailed environmental management plans. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the Borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
As part of the EAs, environmental management plans (EMP) detailing potential risks and mitigating 
measures, were developed for CAI and SSH.  The Borrower endorsed the arrangements described in the 
EMPs, and the Land Acquisition Assessments.  The Borrower has limited capacity to implement the 
measures described in the EMPs.  Therefore, as part of the Project's technical assistance component, noise 
and air monitoring equipment will be procured and installed at CAI and SSH, and qualified international 
consultants will be hired to ensure that the EMPs are properly implemented. 
Page  5
 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The EAs included social assessments, which were conducted to identify key stakeholders, determine the 
extent of any potential impacts, and verify land ownership.  Key stakeholders include communities around 
the two airports and airport employees.  Scoping sessions and public consultations were conducted in Cairo 
and Sharm El Sheikh at various stages of project preparation, and the final EAs were disclosed at the 
Bank’s InfoShop and at five different Governmental entities in Egypt.
