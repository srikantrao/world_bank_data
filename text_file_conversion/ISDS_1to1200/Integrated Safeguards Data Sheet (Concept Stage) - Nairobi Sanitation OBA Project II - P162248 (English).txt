    B. Project Development Objective(s)
    The development objective of the project is to increase access to sanitation and water services in selected
    low-income communities of Nairobi.
    C. Project Description


    D. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
    (if known)
    The project activities will be carried out in twelve of Nairobi's informal settlements: Kayole Soweto,
    River Bank, Matopeni, Mukuru, Mathare, Huruma, Maili Saba, Mowlem, Canaan, Mwengenye,
    Kawangware, and Kibera.

    Nairobi's slums demonstrate the magnitude of the challenges and opportunities for poverty reduction in
    these settlements. The National Bureau of Statistics conservatively estimates that, within Nairobi's
    administrative boundary, at least 30 percent of the population lives in slums. With the 2009 census
    reporting Nairobi's total population as 3.2 million, the city's slum population now stands at almost one
    million people. Recent in depth research supported by the World Bank reveals both encouraging and
    discouraging development indicators in Nairobi's slums. The incidence of economic poverty is very high
    with 73 percent of slum residents fall below the poverty line. Unemployment is also high (26 percent),
    and living conditions are poor (only 3 percent

    Rapid growth of informal slum settlements in the city of Nairobi can be attributed to a number of factors
    among them increasing income inequalities and urban poverty, increasing rates of rural urban migration,
    inefficient land delivery systems, high costs of urban living and poor investment in low income housing,
    among other factors. In these low income areas of Nairobi, basic amenities such as water, sanitation
    facilities including toilets and designed drainage and sewage systems as well as garbage dumping sites
    are lacking. Some of the low income areas have recently seen developments to improve basic services.
    E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
    The NCWSC has developed an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) as part of
    activities under the Nairobi Sanitation OBA Project (P131512), which will cover all the activities of this
    project. The ESIA has been reviewed and cleared by the World Bank. The NCWSC also has a team
    consisting of an environmental specialist and three sociologists that will support the environmental and
    social aspects of this project.
