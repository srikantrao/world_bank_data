The safeguard classification for this project was C. Late at Appraisal and during negotiations, however, the
Borrower brought to the attention of IDA of the need to construct a building to provide suitable premises
for government entities to achieve project objectives under Component 2. Based on this late and new
information, the Project team has been advised by ASPEN to prepare a site specific Environmental
Management Plan, which will deal with potential impacts, all being minor and exclusively construction
related. This instrument is currently under preparation and will be reviewed, approved, and disclosed in
country and at Infoshop, prior to Board presentation.




II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Comments
The project's ISDS has been reviewed and categorized as C which is appropriate since the activities are
focused on institutional capacity building. The Safeguards category is S3 which is also appropriate since
no safeguards have been triggered. The ISDS is hereby cleared and should be disclosed.
