improve service delivery capacity in selected sectors".

3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
           The World Bank                                                                                                  RESTRUCTURING ISDS
           Public Sector Capacity and Performance for Service Delivery (P145261)



1.       The project financed with an IDA grant of originally US$40 million equivalent of SDR 26.1 million with the
objective to “strengthen public investment management capacity and civil servant performance evaluation process es
in targeted ministries in order to improve service delivery outcomes”, was approved by the Board on March 7, 2014. It
was signed on April 29, 2014 and was declared effective on September 29, 2014. Originally, the project was structured
around two components; one component based on results based financing for programs for service delivery (US$25
million) and one providing financing for technical assistance (US$15 million).1

                                                    Chart 1: Key changes in the project




2.       In line with the proposed PDO revision, a modified results framework (RF) is proposed which takes into account
the changes in project activities and components and that will better reflect project outputs and outcomes. Following
the principle of a simplified, coherent and measurable RF with a clear articulation of expected outputs and outcome, the
following changes are proposed: (i) introducing five new PDO indicators that are outcome orientated and relevant for the
revised PDO instead of the original six PDO indicators; (ii) replacing the 13 Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) and 12
Eligible Expenditure Programs by one new DLI which is output oriented to ensure the timely disbursements and one
Eligible Expenditure Program; (iv) replacing the 25 intermediate indicators by 12 new intermediate indicators as the
former have become either irrelevant or are difficult to measure; and (v) taking into account the slow implementation
pace, introducing new targets that reflect measurable and realistic results.

  The first component supports activities identified in 12 selected Eligible Expenditure programs (EEPs) that are part of the N igerien Government’s
annual budget and address public sector capacity as well as reform priorities in sector programs. Funding of the EEPs is results-based and depends
on the achievement of the program results measured against 13 Disbursement Linked Indicators (“DLIs”). The second component s eeks to facilitate
the achievement of the program results by focusing on capacity development and technology. Funding of this component is input based and not
linked to the DLIs.

3.        The proposed change of the components refers to introducing a functional orientation of the components
around Human Resource Management, Public Financial Management and Change Management; this requires the
replacement of the two initial components by three new components. The initial components one “Supporting Programs
for Service Delivery Results” and two “Technical Assistance for Capacity Development” will be dropped and replaced by
the following three components: (1) “Improve Human Resource Management”; (2) “Strengthen Public Financial
Management” and (3) “Change Management» (see Table 3 below). The structure of the new components has been
designed to improve clarity in terms of reform areas supported by the project and available financing, which is expected
to facilitate project implementation. There are strong linkages between the HRM and PFM component and the change
management component will provide complementary assistance to HRM and PFM reforms. Activities that will be funded
under the proposed restructured project have been clearly identified and formulated to ensure that they will contribute
to the achievement of the project’s objective (see Table 4 below).

         function of MoP, (b) investment planning and

         Taking into account the new operational and
         institutional set up of the project, all activities have
         been revised and mainstreamed across the three new
         components (notably under HRM, budget planning,
         procurement, IT and change management).
         E.) Project Implementation Support, including the
         strengthening of the operating capacity of the M&E
         unit of the MoP.
         This activity has been dropped. Training and TA
         activities will be conducted for the M&E Unit under the
         components “Improve HRM” and “Change
         Management”.



5.       Project funding arrangements are better geared towards the implementation of the components and adapted
to the needs expressed by the project stakeholders during the restructuring process. The proposed changes in the
funding arrangements imply a substantial scaling down of the results-based financing (RBF) approach. This is justified by:
(i) the client’s request to use RBF on a limited scale so that the concerned Ministries and Agencies can gain more
experience in using the instrument; (ii) the technical challenges related to the use of RBF in a limited capacity environment
and in a context of substantial macroeconomic and fiscal risk; and (iii) the significant share of technical assistance and
training in the project.

6.       As a result, under the restructured project, RBF will be piloted in support of reforms of the tax and customs
administration, allowing the administration to gain experience in RBF. The implementation of RBF supported reforms,
implemented under the new component 2, will be complemented with targeted technical assistance and will be managed
by the existing reform unit in the Directorate General of Tax in the Ministry of Finance. Total RBF will represent 5.0 percent
of total cost of the project and will finance eligible expenditures, against reaching the four targets of the DLIs. Eligible

expenditures are limited to salaries and allowances of civil servants of the Ministry of Finance of which the Directorate
General of Tax and the Directorate General of Customs are part of. This will allow to fund the staffing cost related to
implementation of the reforms in the tax and customs administration that are supported by the project. All other financing
in the restructured project will use standard World Bank procedures towards training, goods and services.

7.      Building on the project’s initial broad training concept, the new design focuses on large-scale customized public
service training in Niger. The project support will focus on strengthening the national training institutes in public
administration, economy and public financial management and increasing training customized to the needs of the
administration to improve public sector agent’s skills and qualifications.
