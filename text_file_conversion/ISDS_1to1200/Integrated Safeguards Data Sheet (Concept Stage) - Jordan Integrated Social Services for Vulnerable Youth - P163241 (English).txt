    B. Project Development Objective(s)
    The project development objective is to improve the quality of life of vulnerable youth by increasing the
    provision of services to young people, by increasing the participation of youth in decision-making
    related to these services, and by empowering local NGOs/service providers and communities.
    C. Project Description


    D. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
    (if known)
    The Project will be implemented in East Amman and locations within the Ahgwar area. East Amman
    and the Ahgwar area, which cuts across several governorates, are amongst the poorest and least
    developed areas of Jordan, with significant infrastructure and service deficits. Communities in the
    Project area suffer from the highest poverty rates, while also being home to a large number of less
    educated and disadvantaged youth. No Safeguard analysis is required.
    E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
    As a category 'C' project, no further safeguards action is required.
