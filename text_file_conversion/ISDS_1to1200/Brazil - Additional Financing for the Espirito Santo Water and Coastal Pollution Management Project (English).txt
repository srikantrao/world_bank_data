A.2. Project Objectives 
 
A US$154 million loan for the 
Espírito Santo Water And Coastal Pollution Management 
Project
 was approved by the Board on June 28, 1994. The estimated total project cost at 
appraisal was US$308 million, including US$92.5 million in counterpart funds from the 
State of Espírito Santo and US$61.5 from the State Water Company, CESAN. The 
project became effective on December 19, 1994 and was hampered by uneven 
implementation performance (both by CESAN and the State Secretariat for the 
Environment (SEAMA)) and a lack of counterpart  funds (mainly those owed by the State 
Government) during much of its original 5-year implementation period. Significantly, the 
State Government failed to secure a parallel loan from the European Investment Bank 
(EIB) which, it was thought at appraisal, would cover all or most of the State 
Government’s counterpart funding obligations. By the original closing date (December 
31, 1999), a large number of sewage collection systems in the Grande Vitória and 
Guarapari areas remained unfinished and unconnected to sewage transmission, treatment 
and disposal infrastructure. Against this backdrop, the project was radically restructured 
in late 1999 and early 2000, US$54 million were cancelled from the loan to bring the 
project’s overall size in line with the State’s ability to implement it and the original 
closing date was extended three times for a total of three and half years. After the 
restructuring, implementation performance improved significantly, to the point where the 
Bank agreed in late 2002 to reinstate a total of US$12.5 million in previously cancelled 
loan

2003, the original US$308 million operation had become a more limited US$183 million 
operation with commensurate reductions in physical outputs and institutional 
achievements.  
 
An addition loan of US$36 million is now proposed to help the State Government meet 
the project’s original development objectives: 
 
1.  to improve the efficiency of CESAN’s water supply and sewerage systems by 
supporting the company’s efforts to operate on a commercial basis with financial 
self-sufficiency;  
 
2.  to increase the coverage level of CESAN’s water supply and basic sanitation 
services (i.e. sewage collection, treatment and disposal) in the urban areas of 
Grande Vitória, Guarapari…and other towns in the Santa Maria and Jucu river 
basins; and 
 
3.  to provide appropriate water and sanitation infrastructure in low-income urban 
areas of Grande Vitória and Guarapari. 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The additional loan would finance activities under the following four components: 
 
1. 
Sanitation
. Construction of  additional sewage collection networks that would 
connect to the trunk infrastructure built with financing from loan 3767-BR. In 
addition to allowing about 354,000 additional people to enjoy the benefits of 
piped sewerage, the proposed investments are key to increasing CESAN’s 
revenues from sewage charges and fundamental to increasing capacity 
utilization of 4 large sewage treatment plants (STP’s) in Grande Vitória and 
Guarapari. In addition to the sewage investments that connect to existing 
infrastructure CESAN will construct sewage collection and treatment systems 
in other municipalities in the project area. 
 
2. 
Water Supply
.  Capacity expansions for raw water intakes and water 
treatment plants, construction of storage tanks and distribution mains to 
improve the quality and service continuity of water supply in the Grande 
Vitória and Guarapari metropolitan regions. The proposed investments would 
complement the water supply infrastructure constructed with financing from 
loan 3767-BR. 
 
3. 
Institutional Strengthening of SEAMA/IEMA. 
This component would 
strengthen the environmental management capacity of the State Secretariat of 
the Environment and Water Resources (
Secretaria de Estado do Meio 
Ambiente e Recursos Hídricos
 / SEAMA) which is charged with defining 
Es
p
írito Santo’s environmental 
p
olicies and its sister institution, the State 
Page  4
 
 
Environmental Institute (
Instituto Estadual de Meio Ambiente e Recursos 
Hídricos
 / IEMA) which is responsible for carrying them out. Possible 
activities include (i) the design of an institutional strategy for SEAMA/IEMA; 
(ii) implementation of an integrated environmental information system; (iii) 
improvements to the environmental licensing process in Espírito Santo; (iv) 
implementation of a monitoring network for water resources; (v) construction 
of a water resource management system; (vi) environmental education. 
 
 
 
4.
 
Institutional, Financial and Operational Strengthening of CESAN. 
This 
component would
 
include activities designed to (i) improve CESAN’s 
financial and operational performance; and (ii) to hold CESAN accountable to 
its customers in terms of performance. 
 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
Water supply and sewerage investments will be located in Grande Vitória (Vitória, Vila 
Velha, Cariacica, Serra, Viana municipalities) and Guarapari. All of these areas (except 
for Cariacica and Viana) have beaches and in-land waterways that are contaminated by 
uncollected and untreated sewage discharges. The project will improve the quality of 
these water bodies by connecting additional users to existing secondary sewage treatment 
plants and by constructing new systems in unserved areas (Nova Almeida/Praia Grande 
as well as Manguinhos in Serra; Viana, Guarapari (center)).

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The original project was classified as Category B under the Bank's environmental guidelines, and an 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out at the time of the original appraisal. For the 
activities to be financed under the proposed additional loan, an updated Program Environmental 
Assessment and an updated Environmental Management Plan were prepared and discussed in public 
consultations in Espírito Santo. Water supply and sanitation investments to be carried out under the 
additional loan are classified as category B and are not expected to have either major negative 
environmental impacts or to involve resettlement of population in the project area. Specific environmental 
assessments for individual investments will be carried out as required by local law. Issues that arise in 
conjunction with the implementation of works will be addressed through the incorporation of 
environmental guidelines for contractors as part of bidding documents. These guidelines will include rules 
on the disposal of construction waste in pre-approved landfills, communication with local communities, 
pedestrian safety, dust and noise abatement measures, etc. These guidelines have been reviewed by Bank 
environmental specialists. Expansion of wastewater service is expected to lead to a significant increase in 
sewage collection with health benefits both for local residents along polluted water ways and for users of 
Espírito Santo’s beaches more generally. 
 
No impact on Cultural Property is expected, though appropriate procedures exist to cope with chance finds 
during construction. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
None. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
N/A. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
As stated under D.1., the Borrower has produced an updated Program Environmental 
Assessment and an updated Environmental Management Plan that have been reviewed by 
the Bank. The Borrower’s overall capacity to plan and implement the proposed 
investments is demonstrated by performance over the last 3.5 years of project 
implementation under loan 3767-BR. To strengthen Borrower capacity further, the 
proposed additional loan will also finance strengthening activities for the SEAMA/IEMA 
system, Espírito Santo’s state environmental planning and implementation institutions. 
Some of these activities (including hydro-dynamic modeling of receiving water bodies) 
are a direct result of the updated Program Environmental Assessment. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Management Plan were prepared and discussed in public consultations in Espírito Santo 
in January and February, 2004 after wide-spread publicity via radio and TV. Overall 
project environmental impacts on stakeholders are expected to be extremely positive, as 
proposed sewerage investments will improve water quality at beaches and in inland water 
ways. Construction may cause temporary traffic and noise inconvenience, which will be 
minimized through appropriate construction guidelines in the bidding documents.
