A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of the project is to foster greater integration in the Changsha 
–
Zhuzhou – Xiangtan (CZT) 
region of Hunan Province through support for a carefully selected set of  priority investments to address 
specific regional needs in a sustainable manner.   
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project comprises five components:  
·
The Corridor component
,
to strengthen flood protection and develop a recreational (scenic) road 
along the embankment, in four sections of the three municipalities.   
·
The Changsha Wastewater component
,
to increase the percentage of sewage collected and 
treated in  the municipality, and to develop the Changsha Municipal Drainage Company (CMDC) 
into an autonomous public utility operating on commercial principles. 
·
The Zhuzhou Clean Coal component
,
to reduce air pollution in the CZT Region through the 
production and sale of low sulphur coal. 
·
Zhaoshan Scenic Area component
,
to support improved livability in the CZT Region through 
the sustainable redevelopment of the Zhaoshan scenic area. 
·
Technical Assistance for Implementation and Institutional Development component
,
to assist 
in project implementation, and to build capacity in the CZT Economic Integration Office and other 
project agencies. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
Page  2
analysis: 
 
The project is located in the CZT region of Hunan Province.  One of Hunan’s four major 
rivers, the Xiang River, flows through the CZT region. Eighty percent of the annual flow 
occurs during the wet season from April to September and flooding is common.  Of the 
three municipalities included in the project, Zhuzhou is located furthest upstream, with 
Changsha at the downstream end of the CZT Region, and Xiangtan in the center.    
 
Hunan, in south-central China, is at the median of Chinese provinces in most economic 
criteria with GDP per capita ranking seventeenth, 22% below national average.  
Development of the CZT Region is intended to be the basis upon which Hunan will 
transform from a largely agricultural province into a more balanced economy, with 
growth in tertiary sectors and high technology.  The CZT Region has a total population of 
12.1 million (of whom 3 million live in the core areas of the three cities), and is the only 
significant urban agglomeration in the province.   
 
Changsha is the capital of Hunan Province. It is rich in tourism, mineral and biological 
resources, and it is also the industrial, agriculture, and commercial base of the province. 
Xiangtan and Zhuzhou are industrial cities, known for non-ferrous metal metallurgy and 
processing, machinery, chemical production and building materials.  
 
Surface water quality in the CZT Region is relatively poor. In the river sections running 
through towns and cities, water quality is at Class IV or worse.  TSP, SO2 and soot 
remain the main sources of air pollution in the CZT Region. Air quality in Xiangtan 
complied with Class II standard. Changsha and Zhuzhou exceeded Class III standard. 
Hunan is one of the provinces in China suffering from severe acid rain pollution.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project will result in significant environmental and social benefits for the residents of the CZT Region, 
including: improved flood protection in Changsha, Zhuzhou and Xiangtan; surface water quality 
improvement through wastewater treatment in Changsha; air quality improvement through the production 
and sale of clean coal; and development of recreational areas along the Xiang River corridor, and at 
Zhaoshan Scenic Area.  
Project investments will bring about positive environment
al impacts by meeting the “backlog” need for 
flood protection and environmental infrastructure.   The present environmental problems are serious and the 
provision of this environmental infrastructure is necessary for current needs and to mitigate current 
problems.  Future problems without the project would become even more critical.  The project is not 
expected to induce adverse growth or have extensive secondary impacts.   
 
The adverse impact incurred by land acquisition and relocation will be minimized by 
compensation and rehabilitation of project affected persons through the eight RAPs 
prepared for the project, which cover the Corridor Component, Changsha Wastewater 
Component, and the Zhaoshan Scenic Area Component.  As the Zhuzhou Clean Coal 
component will be implemented within the existing premises of the enterprise, no land 
acquisition or resettlement is required, and hence no RAP is  required for this component.  
The eight RAPs are available in the project files.   
 
The project will potentially cause a variety of short-term environmental impacts during 
construction, e.g., dust, noise, traffic congestion, and soil erosion.  These impacts are 
relatively minor and a series of mitigation measures have been planned to reduce the 
impacts to acceptable levels.  Details of mitigation measures, and the monitoring program 
to ensure their effective implementation, as well as responsibilities, are provided in the 
EA and the EMP.  The Hunan Provincial Project Management Office (PPMO) will have 
an ongoing responsibility to track and report on the monitoring work of all the PIUs, in 
addition to its own direct monitoring activities.  “Mitigation monitoring” procedures have 
been established and the organizations to be responsible for this monitoring have been 
designated. 
 
Potential negative environmental impacts during the operational phase include sludge 
generated from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and rejects from the clean coal 
component.  Sludge from the WWTP will be digested, dewatered and transported to a 
recently opened state-of-the-art sanitary landfill with leachate treatment facilities.  The 
landfill, located about 40 km away from the city center, has an estimated life-span of over 
40 years.  Changsha Municipal Drainage Company has secured an agreement with the 
landfill operator to accept the digested sludge, and has confirmed the sludge hauling 
route.  WWTP sludge will be tested for hazardous materials, even though Changsha is not 
an industrial city, with industrial wastewater accounting only for about 16% of total 
wastewater discharge.
 
Page  5
The Zhuzhou Clean Coal Co. Ltd. intends to sell the rejects from the clean coal 
production to enterprises in Zhuzhou that will burn them in an environmentally 
acceptable manner.  The company will formalize these arrangements, and furnish an 
acceptable disposal plan for the rejects from clean coal production, in order to meet the 
disbursement condition for the Zhuzhou Clean Coal component. 
 
It has been established that no ethnic minority individuals live in the project affected 
areas through: (a) the census survey undertaken during the preparation of the resettlement 
plans, when all households affected by land acquisition and relocation were interviewed; 
and (b) review of residency registration (hukou) of  persons living in project affected 
areas. 
 
The census survey revealed that 25 poor households (95 persons) in the  Changsha 
section of the Corridor component would be adversely affected by the project.  These 
poor persons will be given special consideration, including a subsidy to build new houses 
and additional assistance in rehabilitation.    
 
Women were well represented in the household interviews and in consultation meetings 
for resettlement planning.  Special attention will be paid to the reemployment of women 
affected by land acquisition. 
 
A
total of 15 main access and egress roads have been identified for the scenic road under 
the Corridor Component 
–
four in the Changsha section, three each in the Xiangtan 
Zhaoshan and Xiangtan urban sections, and six in the Zhuzhou section.  Nine of these are 
existing roads, while five others have been included in the project description and will be 
constructed as part of the Corridor Component.  The remaining one in the Xiangtan urban 
section, has been identified as “linked” to the project, and the agreed Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) will apply during the construction of this road using government 
funds.    
 
The Zhaoshan Scenic Area includes a few historical/heritage sites and buildings, such as 
the Tang Dynasty Zhaoshan Temple, Song’s Altar Area (both listed with the Xiangtan 
Municipal Cultural Relics Bureau), and the Qing Dynasty Stone Steps (not currently 
listed).  Besides the construction of new visitor amenities, attractions and supporting 
infrastructure, the Zhaoshan Scenic Area component includes refurbishment and 
conservation of the Zhaoshan Temple and the Qing Dynasty Stone Steps, and the 
construction of a look-out tower on the highest peak of Zhaoshan. 
 
The component has been prepared with due regard to OPN 11.03, Cultural Property.  The 
legal documents include a disbursement condition for this component, which requires 
approval by the relevant bureaus for works to be carried out on historical listed sites.  
Song’s Altar Area will be clearly marked, and no new works will be carried out within 
the 70 meter protection zone.  In addition, all works contracts under this component will 
include a clause on “chance finds” to protect cultural property.  Bank supervision 
missions will include an appropriately qualified person in planning and heritage matters.   
Page  6
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
No potential long-term negative impacts are envisaged. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
An extensive analysis of alternatives was carried out for each component to ensure that 
environmental impact and resettlement would be minimized.  For the Corridor 
component, analysis of alternative widths and alignments for the dyke and scenic road 
resulted in, for example, the choice of diverting the scenic road along National Highway 
107 around Zhaoshan instead of constructing an elevated bridge around Zhaoshan 
Mountain on the edge of the river.  For the Changsha Wastewater component, 
environmental analysis of the selected site for the wastewater treatment plant resulted in 
the site location being changed.  Details of the alternatives analysis conducted for each 
component is given in the project EA. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
On environment, details of mitigation measures, their location, time frame and the 
responsible agencies for their implementation and supervision have been provided in the 
EMP.  The EMP covers such areas as surface and ground water management, air quality 
control, noise management, construction site waste, removal of soil by layer and separate 
stockpiling, covering piles to limit wind erosion, construction of runoff channels and 
water storage, and correct orientation of roads and paths.  EMP annexes contain a series 
of ‘Guidelines’ on site clearance, construction methodology, and debris disposal. 
 
An environment “cell” will be established in the PPMO to implement the EMP, and will 
be staffed with at least one professional.  An environmental specialist from the 
supervision consultant team will ensure that construction is done in an environmentally 
sound manner.  Hunan’s strong commitment to the EA was demonstrated by the careful 
adherence to advice provided by the consultants and Bank missions during the 
preparation of the EA and its approval.   
 
The PPMO will coordinate implementation of the RAPs with the project implementing 
units (PIUs) in the three project cities.  
The PIUs will be responsible for  resettlement 
planning and implementation for their components, and will establish  resettlement 
offices, with appropriate number of staff (typically one to eight).  
Resettlement staff will 
be provided training to build their capacity.
 
The PIUs will be responsible for internal monitoring and will  provide semi-annual 
internal monitoring reports to the PPMO and the Bank.  The Changsha Xinghuan 
Hydropower Engineering Technology Development Co. Ltd. has been engaged as the 
independent monitoring and evaluation agency for resettlement, and will report on 
progress and problems, as well as offer suggestions to the PIUs, the PPMO, and the 
Bank.

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
A
total of 4,197 farmers will be affected due to acquisition of their farmland, of whom 2,866 will be 
rehabilitated by land redistribution and agricultural development, while the remaining 1,331 will continue 
their non-agricultural activities or convert to urban residency.  Forty-one enterprises, employing 1,316 
workers, will close down; some of these enterprises are already bankrupt, while others would not be able to 
continue production, e.g., enterprises excavating sand along the Xiang River.  Workers in these enterprises 
will be rehabilitated in various ways, including: social insurance from the compensation fund  for retired 
workers; monthly subsistence payments (i.e., minimum living allowances) for workers who had already 
lost their jobs due to the bankruptcy of their enterprises; most of the others will be employed in local 
markets, in the communities where they live, or  under the project; and about 10% will be registered at the 
Employment Center, receive training, and will be provided employment based on job opportunities. 
 
Project-affected persons and organizations have been informed about the project and its 
impact through more than 30 formal meetings with primary and secondary stakeholders 
during the preparation of the RAPs.  Additional consultations were held during the 
preparation of component feasibility  studies.  Comments and recommendations received 
from these meetings have been incorporated as appropriate in the feasibility studies and 
RAPs. 
 
Local people were consulted at least twice during EA preparation, and their opinions 
have been reflected in the project design and environmental mitigation measures as 
appropriate.  Public announcements were made about the project and the EA report on 
local radio and television broadcasts, as well as in newspapers.  These announcements 
informed the public of the locations (generally the municipal project management office 
[MPMO] offices in each city) where the EA and the RAPs could be inspected and 
commented on, as well as contact telephone numbers.  Posters summarizing the EA and 
the RAPs were displayed in village centers and public meetings were held.   
 
Both the English and Chinese versions of the draft EIA and the draft RAPs and RPF were 
disclosed in the MPMO offices in Changsha, Xiangtan and Zhuzhou.  Notification of 
disclosure was given in the mass media on December 16, 2003 in the Zhuzhou Daily, on 
December 18, 2003 in the Xiangtan Daily,
and on January 1, 2004 in the Changsha Daily.  
The draft EA and RAP documentation was sent to the Bank’s Infoshop in Washington 
and in Beijing on February 15, 2004 and the final EA and RAP in March 2004.  The final 
EMP was sent to the Bank’s Infoshop in Washington in August 2004.  Details of public 
consultation and information disclosure for each component are available in the project 
files.
