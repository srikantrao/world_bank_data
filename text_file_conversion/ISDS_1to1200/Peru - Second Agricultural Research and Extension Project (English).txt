A.2. Project Objectives 
Project Development Objective (Phase II 2005-2008):  
The overall objective of Phase II Project (of 4 years, between 2005 and 2009) is to contribute to 
the expansion, strengthening and institutional development of the rural agricultural technology 
and innovation system that is pluralistic, decentralized, demand-driven, and led by the private 
sector. 
During the second Phase the project will also establish a unit within MOA that will be responsible 
for policy formulation and coordination of public investments which will contribute to the 
sustainability of the agricultural innovation system.   
Key Performance Indicators of Phase II 
The overall impact
1
of th
e
Phase II Project will be measured using the following indicators:  
Number of farmers (direct and indirect participants, female and indigenous participants) who 
adopt new technologies generated and disseminated through Project activities; Percent of farm 
income increased for direct and indirect participants, female and indigenous participants, through 
adoption of new technologies; Client satisfaction with new technologies or management 
recommendations (% of positive response or ratings); Number of hectares on which new 
environmentally-sound technologies (e.g. soil and water conservation practices, IPM etc) have 
been adopted.  The annex 3 details the proposed indicators for different Project components and 
their instruments of finance.

Alignment with CAS 
This Project strongly supports the Bank Group’s assistance strategy for IBRD borrowers and is 
included in the Bank’s lending program for Peru as stated in the Country Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) while falling within agricultural extension and research, the largest sector of lending to 
agriculture by the Bank.  It contributes to the three central objectives of the CAS as well as the 
Government strategy namely: (a) competitiveness and employment generation, (b) equality and 
social justice, and  (c) creation of an efficient state that is transparent and decentralized, by 
improving competitiveness of the agricultural sector and the creation of a decentralized 
agricultural innovation system.  Equity issues related to empowerment and inclusion of 
marginalized groups would be dealt with in this Project in various ways including the 
continuation of the special fund for indigenous peoples and women.  The Project would also 
support the Government’s efforts to decentralize the agricultural service sector in the country and 
ensure delivery of efficient services in poverty-ridden rural areas.  Overall the Project would help 
Peru to improve the productivity and quality of agri-based food products, improve and modernize 
post-harvest and processing, increase the efficiency of farm-to-market food chains, leading to 
increased income and sustainable development within the framework of environmental and 
natural resource protection and other safeguards.  
Alignment with MDGs 
The rural commitment of the APL program in general and Phase II Project in particular is well 
aligned with the MDGs for 2015 of the Bank largely in the area of eradication of extreme poverty 
and hunger and to a lesser extent to ensure environmental sustainability and to set in place a 
global partnership for development.  The Project would focus on improving the economic 
opportunities and constraints of rural poor households and address some of the issues related to 
agricultural employment driven by innovations as a risk-diversification strategy and escape from 
poverty.   
 
A.3. Project Description 
The Total APL Phase II Project costs is expected to be US $68.63 million (Bank share: US $ 
34.53 million; GOP share: US $ 19.60 million, and Other stakeholders: US $ 14.84 million) and 
have a four year duration beginning June 1, 2005.  The Project would finance the following four 
components the details of which are given in Annex 4: 
Component 1. Strengthening the market for innovation services  
The expected
 
cost US$ 31.32
 
million (Bank share: US $
 
17.01
 
million; GOP: US $
 
8.88
 
million; 
and Others: US $ 5.43
 
million) 
The aim of this component is to advance the development of a decentralized market for 
professional services for agricultural innovation. It will strengthen producer organizations as 
clients of quality services, as well as improving entrepreneurial capacity of private service 
providers. The result will be a more efficient market for services including advisory and business 
services, technical information and training.  Special emphasis will be given to the development 
of instruments that would ensure adequate participation opportunities to vulnerable groups such 
as organizations of indigenous and women groups and those in disadvantaged regions.  To realize 
Page  3
this objective the component will finance: (a) a Competitive Fund that will co-finance subprojects 
in adaptive research and extension based on business plans that reflects producer demands 
including the vulnerable groups such as indigenous populations and women’s organizations; (b) 
co-finance local participants 
fora
,
promote internships of pre-professionals, and training 
workshops, so as to improve the administrative capacities of organizations and agribusiness of 
producers, and to strengthen the capacities of the suppliers with a managerial orientation to 
provision of services.  The participation of technical representatives of Regional Governments of 
the macro-regions would be ensured in the evaluation, priority setting and negotiation of 
subprojects proposals for the competitive fund.  Implementation of the competitive fund will be 
decentralized at the macro-region level.  The local capacity to formulate and implement 
innovative subprojects that contribute to regional agricultural competitiveness will be 
strengthened. 
Component 2. Strengthening the national agricultural research and development system  
The expected
 
cost US$ 21.39
 
million (Bank share: US $ 8.07
 
million; GOP: US $
 
3.91
million; 
and Others: US $
 
9.41
 
million) 
The aim of this component is to strengthen agricultural research and technological development 
for innovation in strategic areas of national importance and to strengthen institutional and 
professional competence.  The component would establish support mechanisms for ‘centers of 
excellence’ in emerging areas of science and technology and for regional training programs in 
high-skill innovation services that are critical to increasing competitiveness of the agricultural 
sector.  The component will manage the Strategic Services Development Fund (FDSE).  The 
FDSE would finance: (a) the strategic national and international alliances to co-finance research 
activities and capacity building initially in three high priority areas -- genetic resources 
conservation and use, biotechnology, and integrated plant and animal management, and which 
would be gradually expanded to include natural resource management (NRM: soils and land 
management, irrigation and water management, agro-forestry), post-harvest handling and 
processing, and sustainable agriculture; (b) the strengthening of regional training and information 
programs for extension service providers and to co-finance curricula with focus on capacity 
building and institutional development; and (c) co-finance training programs for researchers in 
specialties included in high-priority areas of strategic research that require a certain critical mass 
of professional talent.  
Component 3. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E), Information sharing, and Policy 
formulation for innovation  
The expected
 
cost US$ 12.47
 
million (Bank share: US $
 
7.22
million and GOP: US $ 5.35
 
million) 
The aim of this component is to develop the institutional capacity of the public sector to 
formulate and implement agricultural innovation policy in conjunction with the private sector, 
and regulate the quality of the NAIS.  The outcome of this component would be the formation of 
an agricultural technology innovation unit in the modernized MOA that is responsible for the 
definition of policies and would coordinate investments in this sector.  The outputs of this 
component would be: (a) validation of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to generate 
performance measurement standards to measure the results of modernization of the agricultural 
innovation system services; (b) a modernized and systematized information system composed of 
virtual networks which will increase the sector’s capacity to generate and use systematized update 
scientific and technological information; and (c) policy definition on critical areas such as 
promotion of public investments in science and agricultural technology, intellectual property 
rights, and public-private partnerships.  The activities to be financed would be the following:  (a) 
a
M&E system for subprojects using measuring instruments which permit comparison of designs, 
Page  4
identify best practices of quality, submit information to the public scrutiny, reward the best 
subprojects and ensure the achievement of maximum results and desired impacts; (b) an 
information system that is in the public domain and enriched with data generated by subprojects, 
operational plans, and programs in place, available to all stakeholders of the NAIS; and (c) i). 
studies and consultations on prospective technologies and technological forecasting, ii) creation 
of a concerted agenda of the innovation system, iii) identification of the constraints to the 
development, adoption and dissemination of innovations and to define priorities and formulate 
policies designed to overcome these restrictions. 
Component 4. Program/Project Implementation  
The expected
 
cost US$ 3.34 million (Bank share: US $ 1.89 million and GOP: US $ 1.45 million) 
The aim of this component is to finance the present Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which 
would continue to be the implementing agency for the second Phase. The main responsibilities of 
PIU would be to:  (a) implement and monitor the Project at the national level; (b) be the principal 
contact with the World Bank in Project supervision and financial management of the Bank’s and 
public investment including efficient administration of the organizational structure of the Project; 
(c) convene annual program audits; (d) ensure quality assessments of the Project implementation 
in terms of social impacts and environmental safeguards; (e) maintain the Project’s Operational 
Manual up-to-date; (f) implement the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the Project; and (c) 
guide the evolution of the PIU as outlined in the Policy Letter towards a permanent entity in the 
modernized MOA that would have responsibility for the implementation of public programs in 
innovation of rural agriculture sector. The Steering Committee (SC) would oversee the overall 
Project implementation with technical advice provided by the Technical Advisory Committee 
(TAC). The PIU’s organizational arrangement will consist of an Executive Bureau and four units 
–
three of technical nature plus administration.  The technical units will be: a) strengthening the 
market for innovation unit; b) FDSE unit; and c) unit for promotion and quality of policies of the 
agricultural innovation system.  The latter will be in-charge of coordinating and supervising the 
eleven decentralized units, each of which will receive support from its respective Regional 
Consultative Council (RCC). 
The Project would provide for the purchase of additional equipments and vehicles for the 
decentralized units, rehabilitation of premises, and salaries and other operational costs over four 
years.
