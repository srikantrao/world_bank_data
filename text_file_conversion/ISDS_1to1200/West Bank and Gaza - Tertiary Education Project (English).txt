A.2. Project Objectives 
The project development objectives are:  1) to improve the policy making environment 
for tertiary education management, governance and quality assurance; 2) increase internal 
and external efficiency of  tertiary education institutions, as a first step towards achieving 
sustainability; and 3) to create incentives and provide the basis for improvements in , 
quality, relevance and equity of tertiary education institutions in order to meet the 
socioeconomic needs of the Palestinian population. 
 
Key Development Indicators 
 
·
Development of a common framework for the MOEHE, Higher/Tertiary 
Education Council, Quality Assurance Commission, and Tertiary Education 
Institutions, in which to set and enforce tertiary education policies 
·
Development of a common framework and sector goals that will establish the 
basis for donor agencies contributions 
·
Improvement of the managerial capacities and financing mechanisms needed to 
improve efficiency, relevance, quality and equity of tertiary education institutions 
 
The proposed project will contribute to the overall economic and social development of 
Page  2
the PA, as a skilled work force is a determinant factor of economic growth and the 
development of an economy able to compete in international markets.  Unemployment 
and lack of education are respectively the first and second most important factors in 
determining the likelihood of being poor in the WB&G. More so, this Project will 
contribute to the development of a viable Palestinian State, as Higher Education 
institutions and graduates play a key role in the process of reconstruction, nation-building 
and the promotion of a democratic society and political system. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
3.1 Strengthening the policy making role of the Ministry of Education and Higher 
Education (US$1.5 million
)
The objective of this component will be to strengthen the capacity of the MOEHE and the 
Higher Education Council to formulate, plan and monitor the tertiary education policy 
framework for the WB&G.  The Project will support the ongoing reform that will enable 
the tertiary institutions to provide the education programs that meet the needs related to 
the economic and social development of Palestine.  The definition of policies, and the 
incentive mechanisms to put them in practice will be consistent with increasing the 
financial sustainability of the sector, and improving the capacity to respond to labor 
market needs.  In particular the policies will be oriented towards moving away from the 
binary system and into  a Tertiary Education System, seeking to increase enrollment in 
community colleges, moving towards an accreditation system that allows flexibility and 
mobility among post-secondary institutions, and moving towards a more equitable and 
relevant system that offers diversity versus differentiation among “Higher Education” and 
“Vocational Technical” education.  Equally important, policies will be developed and 
enforced to increase enrollments in priority area programs consistent with the 
development of international competitiveness of Palestinian enterprises and industrial 
estates, (as defined in 
Stagnation or Revival? Israeli Disengagement and Palestinian 
Economic Prospects
,
December 2004) controlling admissions in programs where the job 
market demands are saturated and in institutions and programs where quality of the 
programs offered are not relevant or do not meet the standards set by the accreditation 
commission.  In addition, a set of policies seeking to establish financial sustainability and 
improve equity in the use of public funding, such as regulation on fees, student aid 
programs and standardized normative costs will be put in place.  To achieve these 
objectives, the Project will provide support to the following activities: 
 
3.1.1 
Tertiary Education Policy Development and Management
.
To this end, the 
Project will provide support to the Planning Unit at the MOEHE that will be capable of 
conducting analytical reviews regarding the performance of the tertiary education sector 
as a whole.  The unit’s capacity will be developed in order to be able to coordinate and 
develop plans and policies for the sector in collaboration with the Ministry of Labor, 
Economy, Social Affairs, Finance, Planning, United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
for Palestine (UNRWA), Palestinian Federation of Industries, Labor Unions, NGOs, and 
Page  3
development and cooperation agencies.  The Project will support training staff of the 
Planning Unit on Tertiary Education Policy design and assessment; development of 
planning tools and practices; conducting studies and analysis of the performance of the 
system on an annual basis; local and international consultancies and study tours; technical 
workshops and publication and dissemination of system reports.  In order to establish 
linkage between the system and labor market needs, tracer studies will be conducted on a 
yearly basis, to monitor entry of graduates to the labor market. 
 
Activities under this sub-component will include:  
 
·
Establishing a tertiary education Research and Development Unit at the DG) for 
planning, and recruiting a local expertise in planning and educational policy for the 
purpose of producing reports about the system performance on annual basis. 
·
Formation of planning committee composed of Ministry and institutions 
representatives.  This committee will meet on regular basis to discuss and decide on 
policy issues of the system. 
·
Conducting study tours for the planning unit to similar regional and international 
institutions or bodies. 
·
Training existing staff at the DG of Planning on data analysis, reporting and 
dissemination of results. 
 
The Project will also provide support to ensure that the Higher Education Council (HEC) 
will function as a Tertiary Education Council, representing the needs of the universities, 
community colleges, stakeholders representatives such as staff members and students and 
the private sector.  To increase governance, the Council will extend its members to 
include private sector representatives and student organizations.  Through the support 
provided by the Project to the MOEHE Planning Unit, technical reports documenting the 
quality, relevance and financial performance of the system on an annual basis, will be 
presented to the Council to assist them in their policy making function.  The Project will 
provide support to the MOEHE and HEC in order to establish a planning and funding 
mechanism based on higher education demand, academic standards and future labor 
market needs.  Council members will also be eligible for training workshops and study 
tours on Tertiary Education Policy Development and Practice. 
 
Project funds will also be available to: 
 
·
Conduct an analytical review of the role of the Council, its mandate, composition, and 
scope, for the purpose of establishing a tertiary education council that deals with 
policies across the system.  To achieve comprehensive result, the review will also 
examine the role of the education committee within the existing structure of the 
general education sector, and the role of the Higher Council of the TVET. 
·
Conduct an analytical review of the existing Laws of Higher Education, Education, 
and Labor, for the purpose of establishing the proper link between the tertiary system 
and labor market. 
·
Conduct study tours for the various relevant councils to regional and international 
tertiary education bodies.

3.1.2 
Support to quality assurance commission.
 
Quality assurance in tertiary 
education is necessary to ensure that graduate supply meets the social and 
economic needs of the Palestinian economy.  It is also important for the 
development of international reputation and integration of Palestinian tertiary 
institutions.  A coherent system-wide pattern of qualifications and awards is an 
essential feature of any attempt to operationalize the concept of tertiary education.  
This sub-component will provide technical assistance to enhance and reinforce the 
MOEHE’s existing capacity to set quality and management standards able to meet 
and compete with international standards.  The defining of such standards 
includes program and curriculum development, student/teacher ratios according to 
program standards, qualifications and status of faculty, student admissions, 
student academic performance, and monitoring and evaluation of programs.  This 
sub-component will support the existing independent accreditation and evaluation 
commission, and provide support to set up evaluation teams and conduct the 
evaluation of priority area programs through peer review system.  It will also 
provide the support needed so that this commission will operate following 
international standards and trends, and develop networking activities with 
international agencies.
 
Project funds will be available for: 
 
·
Training of staff and commissioners and external reviewers 
·
Improved communication with institutions 
·
Enabling coordination with external funding sources 
·
Regional participation in quality assurance networks 
·
International participation in quality assurance and academic recognition networks 
 
3.1.3 
Support to the establishment of a Tertiary Education Information System
 
Based on the needs assessment on information technology (IT) conducted with financial 
support from USAID, the Project will support the MOEHE and tertiary institutions in 
establishing a system that will provide relevant and timely information on enrollments, 
fees, academic programs, actual resources and standards, student aid programs, financial 
status, employment rates of graduates, of all institutions.  The Project will provide 
hardware and software, as well as training and human resources needed to set up and 
manage the information system in an efficient way, and it will be capable of producing 
reports that will shape policy making and planning.  To this end, the Project will 
strengthen the capacity of the Planning Unit, and will provide support to recruit qualified 
staff with expertise in the use of IT, among the following: 
 
·
Develop an IT system that is capable of integrating a  variety of relevant data, 
produce comprehensive reports, and links with other demographic and economic 
information 
·
Train existing staff at the Planning Department on the use of IT 
·
Produce a set of standardized indicators to be used for the planning processes 
·
Provision of necessary hardware and software

Capacity Building Program conducive to increase internal and external 
efficiency of tertiary education institutions (US$2 million)
The objective of this component will be to improve the internal and external efficiency of 
the universities and community colleges.  To meet these objectives, the Project will 
support the following activities: 
 
3.2.1 Institutional Planning and Management.
 
Based on the Budget Trade-off Model 
(BTM) designed for the preparation of the Financing Strategy in 2000, through the 
support of a PHRD grant, the model was updated, and an institutional model was 
prepared.  The use of the BTM will allow institutions to plan and manage resources in a 
more efficient way.  Universities and colleges will be able to use standardized 
information processing, in order to report statistics and to prepare plans taking into 
consideration student enrollments, types of programs offered, teaching and non-teaching 
staff needs, it will also improve efficiency while preserving quality in improving 
students’ capacity to pay for fees, availability of student-aid programs, and ensuring the 
availability of financial resources other than PA and student fees. 
 
The Project will provide support to improve institutions’ planning and management 
capacity.  This support will include the:  1) development of comprehensive information 
systems that will improve efficiency, produce information used by the BTM and allow 
standard reporting to institutions’ planning bodies, MOEHE and potential donors; and 2) 
training of institutions’ staff members on better planning and management practices. 
 
In addition, institutions will receive support to develop and establish organizational and 
managerial mechanisms that will allow for the efficient implementation of the policies 
and practices set by the MOEHE.  This support will include the assessment and 
evaluation of existing organizational and managerial capacity of Universities and 
Colleges, and the definition of an overall framework to serve as a reference for the 
management and organizational  improvement of these institutions.  This framework 
would include the organization of each core function including pedagogical development, 
interaction with the private sector and other partners, quality control, as well as 
appropriate management tools such as strategic planning, student tracking system, quality 
tests, financial management.  The assessment and development process will capitalize on 
the good practices established and implemented by individual tertiary institutions in order 
to enhance the relevance and feasibility of the proposed organizational and managerial 
system.  Support will also cover the development of mechanisms to enhance the 
cooperation between tertiary institutions in strategic planning and implementation, 
pedagogical development, research and innovation, as well as in the search for 
international partnerships (joint programs with foreign universities), and financial aid 
(grants). 
 
Universities and Colleges will receive support to start strategic planning process.  Over 
time, with the growing availability of information emerging from the information system, 
institutions will move from simple bench marking of performance, to institutional 
development plans to strategic planning.  Institutional Development Plans will include:  
Page  6
a) an institutional mission statement; b) a management improvement plan; c)enrollment 
and staffing projections; and d)financial performance and projections. 
 
Project funds will also be available to establish data hubs at tertiary education 
institutions.  These hubs will be the focal points for liaising with the Planning department 
at the Ministry.  They will also be responsible for institutional data gathering from 
various institutional departments or units; such as financial, registrars, student aid offices, 
and others.  These hubs can be established as separate units or imbedded within existing 
planning unit at tertiary institutions.  Funds will contribute to personnel, hardware and 
software, capacity building and the production of planning manuals. 
 
3.2.2 Support to Quality Units and Institutional Self Evaluation.
 
This subcomponent will 
provide support to the establishment of Quality Units in tertiary institutions, and will 
enhance their capacity to conduct institutional self evaluation and staff training.  In the 
course of project preparation, and under support of a PHRD grant, a Quality Unit was 
launched in each tertiary institution in the WB&G, and all of them participated in a 
training session on the process of institutional self-assessment.  Although each tertiary 
institution will have latitude in the functions of the Quality Unit, they will all have the 
following general functions: 
 
·
Provide coordinating services internal to the institutions for purposes of self-
evaluation and quality improvement; 
·
Provide a focal point for institutional planning, including new program 
development.  This does not necessarily mean that the Quality Unit will do these 
functions but they should be very aware of the various institutional functions and 
how
they fit together to make a quality institution of tertiary education; 
·
As central services are provided in the areas of teaching effectiveness, 
fundraising, and other areas, provide notification to the appropriate sectors of the 
institution; 
·
Provide liaison services with the national accreditation process, including a focal 
point for the coordination of reports to the Accreditation and Quality Assurance 
Commission (AQAC); and 
·
Participation in training programs and system-wide meetings related to quality in 
Palestinian tertiary education. 
 
Project funds will be available for conducting self evaluations, consultants, training, and 
equipment. 
 
3.3  Support to quality improvement of higher education institutions (US$5.5 
million)
The main objective of the Fund will be to create appropriate incentives for institutions to 
improve quality and relevance of the programs offered.  On a competitive basis the 
Quality Improvement Fund (QIF) will provide support to institutions and programs to 
meet international standards; improve relevance of the course offerings vis-a-vis. the job 
market and the economic development of Palestine; and increase their capacity to 
develop income generating programs.  Universities and colleges will apply for quality 
Page  7
improvement grants.  Priority will be given to proposals that undertake the following 
activities: 
 
·
Development of partnership programs, including research and development with 
local and foreign universities, and between universities and colleges; 
·
Development of partnership programs, including research and development with 
the private sector/industry; 
·
Articulate faculty development (including teaching improvement) with academic 
program development; 
·
Improve and or develop programs in priority fields, relevant for labor market 
needs, as defined by the enhance competitiveness of Palestinian enterprises and 
industrial estates ; 
·
Promote consortia or the shared use of learning resources (such as library 
resources, information resources, and laboratory and other equipment; 
·
Promote distance and e-learning; 
·
Improve the quality of institutional information, governance and financial 
management; and 
·
Enhance the capacity to seek alternative funding sources, such as provision of 
training, consulting or research services for public/private sector institutions, in 
local or international markets. 
 
The procedures for grant application, approval process, eligibility criteria, and grant 
implantation are detailed in the QIF Manual, prepared with support from a PHRD Grant. 
 
3.4 Capacity building to improve and expand the demand side subsidies program 
(US$ 1 million) 
The Student Revolving Loan Fund (SRLF) is one important way to help students pay 
their tuition fees, especially in the current economic situation.  It is also considered an 
important tool for ensuring equitable access to Palestinian tertiary education.  
Strengthening the student loan program run by MOEHE and student financial aid more 
generally is an important component of the proposed Bank project for Palestinian tertiary 
education system.
 
This component will provide technical assistance to improve the 
efficiency of the current student loan program, and will set the basis for expansion of the 
financial resources available for funding the student aid programs at large. 
 
3.4.1 Improving Management, Structure and Operation of the Student Revolving Loan 
Fund (SRLF) 
This sub-component will provide support to improve the management capacity of the 
SRLF to better be able to set policies and oversee the implementation of the student loan 
scheme.  Technical support will be extended to strengthening and or establishing the 
student’s aid unit at each tertiary education institution in order to improve their capacities 
to perform within the general guidelines and policies of the SRLF.  Funds will be 
available to the following activities: 
 
·
Conducting study visits to SRLF Board members to similar bodies within the 
region and abroad. 
Page  8
·
Training of management staff of the SRLF on student’s aid strategic planning, 
financial management, and communication. 
·
Training staff at students’ aid units on managing student aid programs and on 
information system component. 
·
Building an SRLF information system component to achieve relevant link with 
the different component of the Tertiary Education Management Information 
System (TEMIS) and BTM. 
 
3.4.1.1 Improving the operation and performance of the SRLF 
This sub-component will focus more on the operational mechanisms of the SRLF in order 
to improve its capacity to address the real need of the students.  Activities under this will 
include the following: 
 
·
Designing and implementing a uniform application for loans 
·
Producing a manual for SRLF operation, including eligibility criteria, conditions 
for guarantors, application processes and application dates. 
·
Designing and implementing a uniform reporting system. 
 
3.4.1.2 Implementing Repayment Mechanisms 
The principle concern with the operation of the SRLF is the anticipated low level of 
repayments of loans disbursed since 2001.  This sub-component will provide support to 
introduce an appropriate and acceptable repayment mechanisms and procedures to 
achieve that goal, through the following: 
 
·
Conducting an  awareness campaign on SRLF targeting students, families, 
student’s bodies and society at large using different dissemination modalities. 
·
Designing a scheme of repayment of loan for enrolled students, involving tertiary 
institutions. 
·
Designing and implementing a scheme for % repayment of loan upon graduation, 
involving tertiary institutions. 
·
Contracting commercial banks for the repayment of loans after graduation. 
 
3.4.2 Building a student aid program for the future 
A
mixture of loans, scholarships, and grants will be provided linked both to merit and 
need.  Such a system is explained in the following grid.  Students with the highest need 
and the highest levels of merit would be eligible for the most attractive scholarship 
packages while students with less need and less merit would be eligible for less attractive 
scholarships and loans.

school results. 
·
Training social workers at schools to conduct students financial need. 
 
Selection criteria and verification of income and academic performance will be strictly 
enforced as eligibility criteria for student aid programs.  An analysis of the gradual 
increase of fees for the period of 2004-2010 and the estimated student population that 
will need loans in order to access tertiary education institutions will be done during the 
first year of project implementation in order to calculate the financial resources needed to 
provide student aid programs.  Private sector involvement in management and financing 
of the student loans programs will be implemented.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
A
social assessment was conducted, aimed at assessing the anticipated impact of the 
Higher education support project in Palestine, and was based on analyzing a number of 
parameters that take into consideration the different higher education institutions, 
including universities, institutes and colleges, as well as the Jerusalem Open University 
with its peculiarities.  Such parameters also take into consideration the different forms of 
higher education: vocational, technical and academic, as well as different educational 
levels (diploma and bachelors).  Samples included three categories: Students enrolled in 
higher education, graduates of these higher education institutions, and persons who have 
completed high school but are not enrolled in higher education institutions.  The 
following conclusions were made: 
 
First: The study revealed a clear relationship between the socio-economic conditions of 
Palestinian household and the rate of enrollment of their sons/daughters: the better the 
socio-economic conditions of households, the larger was the possibility of enrolment of 
their sons/daughters in higher education.  This is attributed to the fact that the Palestinian 
household is the major source of financing for higher education. 
 
Second:  The study pointed out the existence of a definite relationship between the socio-
economic conditions of Palestinian households and the quality of the educational 
institutions in which their sons/daughters are enrolled, as it revealed that better socio-
economic conditions of households increased the possibilities of enrolment in closed 
universities, while worse conditions led to a decrease in this possibility and an increase in 
the rate of enrolment in colleges, institutes or in the Open University. 
 
Third:  The study revealed a relationship between the level of education of the parents 
and the chances of enrolment in higher education on one hand, and the selection of higher 
education institutions on the other hand.  The Study showed that the higher level of 
education of the father and/or the mother increased the possibility of enrolment of sons/ 
daughters in higher education, and enhanced the selection of closed universities.  
 
Fourth:  The study showed that, among several factors that resulted in limiting the 
possibilities of enrolment in higher education, the financial factor was the strongest for 
both sexes, while the social factor ranked as the second most important factor that limited 
enrolment in higher education for females. 
 
Fifth:  The importance of loans and financial support in general in fostering the chances 
of enrolment in higher education was highlighted in the study, which also showed that the 
possibility of receiving loans was higher for males than for females.  This led to the 
conclusion that improving access to loans for females enhanced the possibilities for their 
enrolment in higher education.  
 
Page  12
Sixth:  The study indicated that enhancing the chances for employment, and consequently 
improving the socio-economic conditions of households, was among the most important 
reasons for enrolment in higher education for both males and females. This stresses the 
importance of higher education in alleviating unemployment and poverty in the 
Palestinian society. 
 
Seventh: The study pointed out the limited effectiveness of available assistance (grants 
and loans), especially social grants, which are minimal and need to expand to include 
broader categories. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
1- 
The increase in household income and spending had a positive influence over 
the increase in the possibilities of enrolment in higher education, and vice 
versa.   
2- 
A higher proportion of the surveyed sample who have classified their 
household conditions as "poor" or "very poor" were not enrolled in higher 
education, while their proportion was less among those either enrolled or 
graduates of these institutions. 
3- 
Employment had a clear impact over the increase in possibilities of enrolment 
in higher education, while unemployment had a negative impact that limited 
such chances. 
4- 
Household responsibilities hindered the possibility of enrolment in higher 
education to those surveyed and who classified themselves as heads of 
household. 
5- 
Early marriage was one of the obstacles that hindered female enrolment in 
higher education. 
 
6
Gender and place of residence influenced the choice of institution at which 
students were   enrolled: Females and residents of refugee camps had a higher rate of 
enrolment in colleges, in comparison with closed or open universities. 
7
The economic conditions of households that are a function of income and 
spending indicators, as well as the self assessment of the family, 
influenced the quality of the higher education institutes at which 
sons/daughters were enrolled. The higher the income and spending of a 
household, and the more the family had self-esteem, the higher was the 
possibility of the selection of closed universities. 
8
The Open University provided a significant opportunity for students 
belonging to older age groups, in comparison with closed universities or 
colleges. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Page  13
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
1- 
Activating and expanding loan and assistance programs, due to their 
importance in enhancing the opportunities of enrolment in higher education, 
especially among females and limited income households. 
2- 
The need to develop a clear and encouraging lending policy for students that 
will reduce the burden of higher education off Palestinian families on one 
hand, and will ensure sustainable sources of funding for higher education on 
the other hand. Such a lending policy must be compliant with the objectives 
and policies of the MOEHE, orienting students and encouraging them to 
enroll in fields that meet the existing demand in the local market. 
3- 
Re-organizing the existing loan and grant programs to ensure better access for 
the least privileged.  This requires developing clear principles for the benefit 
of target groups that would facilitate and encourage access.  Furthermore, this 
necessitates regulating these loans/grants in terms of provision to 
beneficiaries, pace of disbursement and sustainability. 
4- 
Stressing the importance of compiling all assistance data (loans, grants) at the 
Ministry, overcoming the lack of sufficient documentation at the institutes of 
higher education. Such data must be accessible and compliant to certain 
criteria and indicators, so that it can be utilized in the effective evaluation of 
different programs, allowing for efficient planning and maximization of 
results. 
 
The PA has in place the mechanisms to set up these recommendations, 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
