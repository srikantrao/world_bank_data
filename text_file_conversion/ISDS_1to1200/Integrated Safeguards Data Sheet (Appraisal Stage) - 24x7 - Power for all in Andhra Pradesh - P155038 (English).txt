                           The development objective of the project is to increase the delivery of electricity to customers and to
                           improve the operational efficiency and system reliability in distribution of electricity in selected
                           areas in Andhra Pradesh.
                            3. Project Description
                           The key components under the proposed Project are as follows:



                                                                        Page 1 of 10

                         million)
Public Disclosure Copy




                         This component will make priority investments in 220 kV, 132 kV, 66 kV, and 33 kV transmission
                         and sub-transmission lines and associated substations, to strengthen and augment the power system.
                         The specific investments proposed by the state have been verified based on a load flow study. These
                         investments will reduce overall transmission system losses and increase the capacity of the state
                         transmission network to enable it to meet demand growth. A long list of twelve substations and the
                         associated lines have been identified. These packages will be implemented through integrated
                         turnkey supply and installation (S&I) contracts.

                         Component 2: Smart Grid Development in Urban Areas (US$ 182 million of which IBRD $127
                         million)

                         The Government of India has launched a "➂❨➂ Smart Cities Mission"➂ , which aims to identify and
                         develop a number of selected cities across India as "➂❨➂ smart cities"➂ . It is expected that the
                         development of these cities will develop a "➂❨➂ smart city"➂❨➂ model which can then be
                         replicated throughout the country. In Andhra Pradesh, Kakinada, Vishakhapatnam and Tirupati have
                         been selected for development as smart cities in the Smart Cities Challenge / conducted by GoI. This
                         component would support investments in smart grids and underground cables in the above mentioned
                         three cities. These investments would include smart meters for selected consumers, distribution
                         SCADA /, automated sub-stations, and ring main units. It also includes investments in distribution
                         network strengthening & augmentation (33kV and below) in urban areas, to meet growing power
                         demand, reduce technical & commercial losses, improve operational efficiency and increase the
                         system reliability especially in coastal towns prone to natural calamities.

Public Disclosure Copy




                         This component would support strengthening and augmentation of the distribution network (33kV
                         and below) and construction of the High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) in rural areas. The
                         majority of the investments under this component are located in Anantapur and Kurnool - the two
                         new districts that have been transferred to APSPDCL post the restructuring of the State. The power
                         infrastructure in these districts is poor and the majority of power transformers, distribution
                         transformers and feeder lines are overloaded, leading to frequent outages and high technical losses.
                         As advised by the state, the AT&C losses in Anantapur and Kurnool districts are 18.3% and 10.8%
                         respectively.

                         The objective of this component is to reduce distribution system losses, increase the capacity of the
                         distribution network to meet growing load demand, improve system reliability, and improve the
                         quality of supply to end consumers. The specific investment components are briefly described below:

                             i.    Rural HVDS: System losses will be reduced by replacement of the low voltage network
                         with a high voltage distribution system (HVDS), and installation of a smaller capacity Distribution
                         Transformers (DTR) to enable supply to two to three agriculture consumers per transformer. Andhra
                         Pradesh has already implemented rural HVDS for a majority of its agricultural consumers with loss
                         reductions and positive consumer feedback. An independent study / shows that, overtime, the
                         distribution transformer failure rate has been red uced significantly, and the quality of supply has

                         improved. Under this project, AP plans to cover the agriculture consumers which are still not
                         supplied by rural HVDS (i.e. around 30,000 agriculture consumers in APEPDCL), and convert all
                         agricultural consumers in Anantapur and Kurnool to rural HVDS.

                             ii. Distribution Network Strengthening & Augmentation: This includes the investments required
                         to augment and strengthen the distribution infrastructure in rural areas of the state. These investments
                         are expected to improve the quality of supply in the intervention areas.

                         Component 4: Energy Efficient Pump Sets (US$ 10 million of which IBRD $7 million)

                         This component builds upon the learnings and experience of the above mentioned GOI scheme
                         National Energy Efficient Agriculture Pumps Program which is currently under implementation in
                         West Godavari district. This component would support the replacement of around 30,000 existing
                         agricultural pump sets with BEE rated five star energy efficient pump sets, across APSPDCL. For the
                         remaining pump sets in the selected area/ district, the project will support the installation of smart
                         control panels on the pump sets to allow remote control and the ability to better control electricity
                         consumption. This not only result in savings in agricultural electricity supply (which is subsidized
                         by the State), but will also provide an opportunity to develop an informed estimate of the electricity
                         being consumed in the agriculture sector.

                         Component 5: Technical Assistance for Institutional Development and Capacity Building (IBRD $10
                         million)

                         This component would improve the project management capabilities and commercial performance of
                         the AP utilities by (i) Improving ICT systems, (ii) improving the business processes, (iii) support
                         supervision of contracts through Project Management Consultants, and (iv) building staff capacity
                         through training, workshops, and study tours.

                             Andhra Pradesh is a highly diverse state in terms of social, economic, cultural and geographic

                             characteristics. Its population of 49.5 million accounts for 4.10% of the country's population
                             makes it the tenth most populous state in the country. The bulk of the population (71%) lives in
                             rural areas and the remaining 29% live in urban areas. There are 12.72 million households in the
                             State and the average size of the household is four. Inter and intra district demographic variations
                             are quite substantial, given that the state has huge tracts of upland, forests and coastal areas. Social
                             diversity is reflected in sizeable populations of Scheduled Caste (SC) (17%) and Scheduled Tribe
                             (ST) 5.5 percent. Out of the total scheduled tribes in Andhra Pradesh, approximately 50% reside in
                             four districts Vishakhapatnam (23%), East Godavari (11%), Nellore (10%) and Vizianagaram
                             (9%). There are 34 major tribal groups and six primitive tribal groups inhabiting the state. Given
                             the preponderance of tribal communities and compactness as well as collective attachment to the
                             natural forest based environ, in certain pockets, safeguards have been built to ensure risks against
                             land alienation and other socio-economic exploitations. This provision, enshrined under the Fifth
                             Schedule of the Indian Constitution, recognizes several some tribal pockets in Vishakhapatnam,
                             West Godavari and East Godavari districts. These areas are also prone to insurgency and conflict.
                             Tribal People of Andhra Pradesh are economically and technologically better equipped than the
                             tribes of other states.. Yet, remoteness and undulating hilly terrain could render them rather
                             excluded at times.

                             Major social safeguards aspects relate to land and tribal people. The project will require lands for
                             the (a) erection of towers to draw transmission lines and (b) construction of T&D substations. The

                         former does not entail permanent acquisition of lands, but creates some temporary damages,
                         thereby demanding a Compensatory Plan for Temporary Damages (CPTD). The latter, however,
                         does require land on a permanent basis. The state has reported that there may be no need to acquire
Public Disclosure Copy




                         lands involuntarily as the government lands are available in most cases. A few may be purchased
                         in a willing buyer-willing basis at a negotiated rate. However, towards managing unforeseen
                         circumstances, project has prepared itself for managing involuntary land acquisitions too for
                         establishing transmission stations. For CPTD, the state intends to make use of the existing
                         legislation Electricity Act of 2003 and Indian Telegraph Act of 1885. Further, some of the
                         facilities may be taken up in scheduled/ tribal areas. In view of this situation, the project triggers
                         OP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement and OP 4.10 - Indigenous Peoples.

                         To ensure compliance with the policies concerning safeguards management, the project has
                         adopted a framework approach as all the investments have not yet been identified. Therefore, the
                         state has prepared an Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) which is a generic
                         document that serves as a framework and can be adopted for all sub projects .. Essentially, the
                         framework is prepared based on the recently approved World Bank assisted North East Power
                         Systems Improvement Project Power System Improvement Project and incorporates due
                         requirements of Indiasnew ➂❨➂ The Right to Fair Compensation in Land Acquisition,
                         Resettlement and Rehabilitation Act 2013Ã¢➂❨➂ (LARR 2013) as well as Indian Constitutions
                         Fifth Schedule provision related to protecting the interest of the tribal people.

                         The ESMFs social content embodies a synthesis of the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)
                         (according to OP 4.12) and a Tribal People Development Planning Framework (TPPF) (according
                         to OP 4.10). In cases where land is to be acquired and/or there are tribal peoples in the subproject
                         area, the framework will be adopted and a Social Assessment (SA) will be carried out to enable
                         preparation of an RAP and/or Tribal Peoples Plan (TPP) as appropriate.. The Framework lays
                         down the modalities for undertaking the SA as well as the preparation and implementation of the
                         RAP and TPPs. In such cases, wherein, lands need not be acquired involuntarily, the land will be

                         secured through either voluntary donations or outright purchases based on negotiations with the
                         land owners. Measures have been described in the Framework to ensure that such transactions are
                         voluntary and not subject to any external pressures.

                         One major issue to be resolved relates to detailing compensations to be paid in the case of ROW/
                         CPTD. GOAP is in broad agreement on complying with the s tipulations laid out under the
                         Bank➢❨ s policy OP 4.12 as well as the Indian National legislation as detailed in the Central
                         Electricity Act of 2003. Both policies stipulate that there is no need to acquire lands, but, makes a
                         provision for extending easement assistance or compensations. Following this, it has been agreed
                         that: (i) land under the tower footing, though need not require to be acquired, shall be fully
                         compensated and allowed to use the land ( raising the crops) under the footing; and (ii) all
                         damages / disturbances ( crops, structures, trees, equipment etc.) shall be compensated fully.
                         However, detailing of the implementation modalities are being worked out. The Bank requires
                         that: (i) agreements are formalized by GOAP; and (ii) that all individual RAPs are necessarily be
                         reviewed and agreed with the Bank before implementation. All these issues are expected to be
                         resolved during project appraisal.


                         Environment Potential impacts identified during the implementation phase include clearance/

                           modest, site-specific and reversible in nature where, mitigation measures can be managed to
                           reduce the negative impacts of the interventions. It is possible that the installation of energy
                           efficient pumps, if run for the same duration as inefficient pumps, could lead to sub-optimal water
                           use or wastage. In view of this, the project is classified as Category B.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           Not anticipated.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           One of its objectives of the ESMF is to minimize negative impacts and maximize positive impacts.
                           Careful site selection is built into the framework so that adverse impacts can be minimized. Sub-
                           project specific documents will include description of alternatives considered in for minimizing
                           potential adverse impacts.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The ESMF will guide the sub-project specific assessments for environmental and social aspects. It
                           provides guidance on preparation of SAs/EIAs and ESMPs for sub-projects, along with samples of
                           outputs expected before implementation. It includes methodologies to be adopted for consultation
                           and options for mitigation and management. In addition, significant emphasis has been put on safe
                           management of implementation of transmission as well as distribution sub-projects. Guidance is
                           also provided for reporting and monitoring. Capacity building measures including training session
                           descriptions have been identified for various levels of staff in the utilities. Line items budgetary
                           resource needs have been estimated that would be frozen for each scheme as the detailed

                          BORROWERs CAPACITY: As the state got bifurcated (into Andhra Pradesh and Telengana) in
                          2014, the power transmission and distribution in AP now rests with three entities: (i)
                          APTRANSCO or Power Transmission Corporation of AP Ltd. with a state wide mandate for
                          constructing, operating and maintaining the power transmission network in the state; (ii) Southern
                          Power Distribution Company o APSPDCL, covering eight districts; and (iii) Eastern Power
                          Distribution Company or APEPDCL for five districts in the remaining part of the state. These
                          three Implementing Agencies, which are expected to handle most of the investments, have
                          considerable knowledge and experience of addressing environment and social safeguard issues as
                          they have implemented, or are currently implementing, several projects financed by bi-lateral and
                          multi-lateral agencies. One such project is the ongoing World Bank financed Andhra Pradesh
                          Disaster Recovery Project involving underground cabling in Vishakhapatnam. The other, recently
                          launched, is the Andhra Pradesh Green Energy Corridors Project, financed by KfW.

                          In context of the limited impacts of transmission line infrastructure on the biophysical
                          environment, the Transco➢❨ s environmental and social cell is adequate to handle the issues
                          where no significant environmental receptors like Natural Habitats are involved. Similarly, for the


                                                                     Page 7 of 10
                           distribution works, having common staff is normally adequate for handling the small-scale
                           impacts. However, if subsequent sub-projects reveal a different nature/scale of impacts, this
                           capacity may need to be augmented with focused external inputs ➢❨ such as for biodiversity.

                           Towards mainstreaming social and environment aspects, the project will invest in building
                           dedicated social and environmental capacity in each of the Implementing Agencies and enable
                           development of a robust environmental and social management framework. It has also been agreed
