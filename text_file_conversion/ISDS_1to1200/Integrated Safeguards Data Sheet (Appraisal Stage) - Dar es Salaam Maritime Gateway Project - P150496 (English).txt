    2. Project Development Objective(s)
    The Project Development Objective is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Port of Dar es Salaam,
    for the benefit of public and private stakeholders.
    3. Project Description
    The Dar es Salaam Maritime Gateway Project (DSMGP) has been developed as a multi-donor operation to
    improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Port of Dar es Salaam. The components in the proposed
    program are entirely consistent with the objectives of the Government of Tanzania's objectives to address
    spatial, operational, and physical constraints in the port of Dar es Salaam. The following list of components are
    included in the DSMGP:

                                                     Page 1 of 8
Component 1: Improving the Physical Infrastructure (Estimated cost US$ 400 million). The first component
comprises the essential civil works in the port, and the key access infrastructure:

(i) Deepening and strengthening of existing Berths 1 to 7 to 14.5 m below CD, and constructing a new
multipurpose berth at Gerezani Creek;
(ii) Deepening and widening the entrance channel and turning basin in the port to the end of Berth 11 to 15.5 m
below CD;
(iii) Improving the rail linkages and platform in the port; and
(iv) Deepening and strengthening of existing Berths 8-11, to 14.5 m below CD.

Component 2: Institutional Strengthening and Implementation Assistance (Estimated cost US$21 million). The
final component comprises the following two sub-components:

(i) The Institutional Strengthening of TPA
(a) Technical assistance to support the restructuring of TPA to reflect the twin objectives of corporatization of
functional business units under TPA for those berths where TPA will remain the operator, whilst enhancing
TPAâ€™s capacity to act as a landlord, manager and developer of the ports in Tanzania; and assess future private
sector participation;
(b) Capacity building/training for TPA staff to take on the above responsibilities, as a result of the restructuring,
including inter alia necessary support to implement the Environmental and Social Strengthening Plan (ESSP)
and obtain the ISO 14001 Certificate, and building capacity and awareness of climate resilience; and
(c) Procurement of management information systems, Terminal Operating Systems for those berths where TPA
will remain the operator, and a Port Community System for Dar es Salaam port).

(ii) Implementation Assistance
(a) Supervision of construction and dredging works in the port;
(b) Technical Assistance, as required, to the TPA PIT to facilitate the implementation of the project (including
TA to supervise the implementation of the cost accounting manual);
(c) Independent technical auditor; and
(d) Technical Assistance to update the National Port Master-plan to guide the strategic development of the
maritime sector and its hinterland in Tanzania.
4. Project location and Salient physical characteristics                  relevant to the safeguard analysis
(if known)
The Dar es Salaam Port is located in an area called Kurasini in Temeke Municipality of Dar es Salaam City. The
Port's operational area is the predominant land use in the eastern side of Kurasini. The Port covers the whole
area east of Kilwa Road from the south to the Gerezani roundabout in the north. A very small portion of the Port
area, notably the Malindi and Lighters Quays, is within the neighbouring Mchafukoge Ward, in Ilala District.
Dar es Salaam Port has eleven berths, seven of which are currently dedicated to general cargo (including
container, dry bulk, break bulk and Ro-Ro operations) and four to dedicated container operations. Other
facilities include the Malindi and Lighter wharves (for coastal trades), the Kurasini Oil Jetty (KOJ), and the
Single Point Mooring (SPM). The SPM is located on the open side of Kigamboni, at Mjimwema Bay, with
delivery pipelines to storage yards at TIPER and other sites. Within the project core area there are three
geophysical areas that required specific attention during the EIA. These are Gerezani Creek, which comprises
two areas of interest (the Gerezani Creek, within TRL land, and the seaward portion where the future Ro-Ro
Terminal is proposed), and the intertidal area at Kurasini that supports mangrove forests (protected reserves
under the Forestry Act).

The Dar es Salaam Port is within the metropolitan area characterized by a highly built up environment. The Port


                                                  Page 2 of 8
is surrounded by the city centre to the north, consisting of business areas and offices and Tanzania Railway; to
the west are residential areas (Keko and Kilwa Road areas) and small factory areas (especially garages and BP
bulky oil storage areas). The south consists of Kurasini, Mtoni and Mbagala residential areas, public institutions,
bulk oils storage tanks and the Mtoni Dumpsite (now closed). To the east, there is Kigamboni residential area,
TIPER refinery plant, and a few undeveloped plots. The city centre has a central sewer system that discharges
sewage in the harbour mouth through the sea outfall pipe. Many of the areas surrounding the harbour lack
sewers and sewage is largely handled by septic tank and soak away systems. Considering the sandy nature of the
soils, leaking septic tanks and soak away systems are a source of sewage pollution into the harbour through the
groundwater flows.

Generally, the marine ecosystem in the Dar es Salaam harbour is highly exposed to many sources of pollution.
The major pollution sources include port operations, harbour activities (maritime), urban drainage (streams,
rivers and open channels), uncontrolled solid waste and liquid waste disposal in the city centre and urban
periphery areas (directed in the storm water channels). Others include the Kivukoni fish market, the Band beach
swimming club, Kigamboni ferry operations, the Sea outfall sewage pipe, leachate from Mtoni dumpsite,
drainage from Kurasini bulk oil handling areas, underground seepage of liquid wastes from septic tanks etc.
Conceptually Dar es Salaam harbour receives pollutants from within and without the Port environment. The
major concerns are drainage channels and natural water courses that bring in the harbour a variety of pollutants
including sediments. Runoff through Gerezani Creek and the Kizinga River are directly impacting on the
harbour water quality through incessant ingress of polluted water.

                                             The TPA will be responsible for the Project
                                             environmental and social management, ensuring
                                             compliance with the national law and the Bankâ€™s
                                             safeguard policies. In respect of safeguards, the
                                             Environmental Management Section (EMS) within
                                             TPA has prepared an Environmental and Social
                                             Strengthening Plan (ESSP), in order to improve the
                                             capacity of TPA to manage environmental and
                                             social issues in the ports. The main objective of the
                                             ESSP is to achieve long-term environmental, social,
                                             and economic benefits through resource
                                             conservation, waste reduction, and pollution
                                             prevention. The ESSP include some activities
                                             related to training, equipment, and some initiatives
                                             to comply with international standards to be a green
                                             port and to obtain the ISO 14001 Certificate. The
                                             project will support the implementation of the
                                             ESSP.

                                             Separate ESIAs and ESMPs will be prepared for the
                                             proposed dredging of the entrance channel and
                                             turning basin, and the rehabilitation of Berths 8-11,

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04   Yes            This policy is triggered because within the project
                                             are two geophysical areas that requires
                                             consideration and are potentially at risk: a)
                                             Gerezani Creek, which comprises two areas of
                                             focus, and the Gerezani wetland, within Tanzania
                                             Railways Ltd land, and the seaward portion where
                                             the future Ro-Ro Terminal is proposed; and the
                                             intertidal area at Kurasini that supports mangrove
                                             forests (protected reserves under Forestry Act). In
                                             respect of Gerezani, the wetland serves to trap
                                             sediments and pollutants that drains during heavy
                                             rain, and is a feeding ground for avifauna.
                                             According to the ESIA, there are no particular
                                             sensitive or endangered plant or animal life in the
                                             area, but there is a risk the wetland could be flooded
                                             during the construction phase. Appropriate
                                             mitigation measures have been specified to mitigate
                                             any risk. Kurasini is not expected to be affected by
                                             the project activities, as concluded by the ESIA, but

    II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
    A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
    1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
    any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
    The potential environmental negative impacts identified in the ESIA are the following: i) Extraction of raw
    materials from quarry sites; ii) Increased demand on existing infrastructure and utilities in Temeke Municipal;
    iii) Potential flooding of upper Gerezani Creek area due to accidentally blocking surface water flow into the
    harbor; iv) Reduced berth space at Malindi Wharf impacting existing users transporting goods to Zanzibar; v)
    Increased vehicle traffic; vi) Changes in marine water quality due to potential release of chemicals and heavy
    metals while dredging or backfilling; vii) Marine pollution due to disposal of dredged materials; viii)
    Occupational risks and accidents; ix) Increase in invasive species from increased shipping traffic; x) increased
    marine pollution from improper disposal of waste from marine vessels; xi) Increase in HIV/AIDs infection rate;
    xii) Accidental vessel collisions during dredging; xiii) Accidental collisions of vehicles and trains within the
    port area; and xiv) Accidental spills of oils. This ESIA covers the construction of the multipurpose berth at
    Gerezani Creek, and the rehabilitation and strengthening of Berths 1-7. A separate ESIA will be prepared for
    each subsequent capital project: including the dredging of the entrance channel and turning basin, and the


                                                    Page 5 of 8
rehabilitation and strengthening of Berths 8-11.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area:
All the major project activities are expected to take place within the port boundaries, on TPA owned land and
therefore no land acquisition is envisaged for this project activities. TPAâ€™s current work force, both formal and
informal worker in the port, as at March 31, 2016, amounted to 3,691 permanent staff, of which 2,793 are male
and 898 are female. The majority of these employees work in Dar es Salaam Port. TPA have confirmed that the
project will have no impact on TPA employees, or casual workers in the port.

The main social impact is the potential impact resulting from an influx of labor into the area during construction,
for example, increase in the incidence of HIV/AIDS/STD infections in the project area, etc. As part of their
Environmental, Health and Safety Management Plan (EHSMP), contractors/construction companies will
establish a HIV/AIDS/STD management plan that includes education and sensitization on HIV/AIDS/STD,
zero-tolerance on sexual harassment, exploitation of minors, etc., which will be implemented in collaboration
with the relevant existing district systems and structures. Following recent events elsewhere in the East Africa
Region, this project will benefit from the guidance note that has been prepared on this specific topic.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
The ESIA presents project alternatives in each component to avoid or minimize the environmental and social
negative impacts or issues that are expected throughout the project cycle i.e. mobilization phase, construction,
demobilization, and operation for the preferred alternative.

The environment analysis of alternatives were considered for the following components: a) Construction
alternatives for deepening and strengthening of Berths 1 to 7; b) Location alternatives for the proposed Ro-Ro
terminal/multipurpose berth at Gerezani Creek; c) Construction alternatives for the proposed Ro-Ro terminal; d)
Alternative backfilling material source for the Ro-Ro terminal; e) Alternative disposing of dredging material
from Ro-Ro terminal and Berths 1 to 7; and f) Alignment alternatives for railway links at the port.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Chapter 7 of the ESIA lists the mitigation measures required for pre-construction, construction, and operation
phases, together with those for cumulative and unplanned impacts.

The TPA is the responsible for the environmental and social management in the project. TPA will ensure
compliance of the national law and the World Banks Operational Policies on Safeguards. The unit responsible
for environmental and social management in TPA is the Environment Management Section (EMS), which was
established in 2010. The EMS has experience and capacity to manage the environmental aspects of the project,
but requires capacity building and strengthening to meet the requirements and risks associated with the projected
increase in traffics. The TPA with the support of the EMS has developed an Environmental Management
System in order to implemented good environmental and social practices in all Tanzanian ports, and to achieve
international accreditation ISO 14001-2004 (in process). Additionally, the EMS has developed an Occupational
Safety, Health, and Environment (OSHE) Policy in 2008; the TPA OSHE Regulations in 2010; and the TPA
OSHE Guidelines and Procedures in March 2013. TPA is also establishing ship waste facilities by end of 2016,
to meet the requirements of the MARPOL Convention.

A specific Environmental and Social Strengthening Plan (ESSP) was prepared by EMS in coordination with the
Bank during the preparation of the project, which will be supported by the project, to strengthen TPA's
environmental and social management.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on


                                                   Page 6 of 8
   safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
   According to the domestic law, and the World Bank's Operational Policy requirements, during the preparation of
   the ESIA, the following stakeholder groups were identified and consulted in a participatory process to ensure
   that they were informed about the main issues related to the project and had the opportunity to raise any
   concerns: 1) Ministries (Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlement Development (MLHHSD), Ministry
   of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT), Ministry ofAgriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (MALF),
   Ministries of Home Affairs (MOHA), Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MOWI); 2) Other public institutions
   (Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS), Marine Parks and
   Reserves Units (MPRU), Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF), Tanzania Railway Limited (TRL), National
   Health Insurance Fund (NHIF)); 3) Private Institutions (Tanzania International Containers Terminal Services
   (TICTS), National Microfinance Bank (NMB), Bandari branch, CRDB Bank, Bandari branch; 4) Donor (Trade
   Mark East Africa (TMEA)); 5) Local Government (Dar es Salaam City Council, and Temeke Municipal
   Council); 6) Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) along Bandari Road (North Star Alliance, and Wake and
   Support Other Organisations (WASO); 7) Ward Executive Officers and Mitaa (Kurasini Ward, Mivinjeni Ward,
   Mivinjeni Street, Kiungani Street, Kurasini Street, and Kiungani Street); 8) Malindi Wharf users; 9) Labour
   agencies (service providers within the Port); 10) Food vendors along Bandari Road; 11) Fishermen (Kurasini
   landing site and Vijibweni); 12) Motorcyclists; and 13) Shipping Agents.

   The establishment of a grievance redress mechanism and the development of a strategic communication plan
   during the project execution are requirements in the ESIA. The Bank is supporting TPA to develop the latter, as
   part of a broader based citizen engagement initiative.
