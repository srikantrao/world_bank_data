A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objectives of this project would be to: (i) improve long-term sustainability of the pension 
system through increasing its efficiency and transparency, developing and strengthening institutional and 
administrative capacities, including improved administration of pension contributions and benefits; and (ii) 
improve the effectiveness, efficiency and targeting of social protection programs through strengthening of 
the institutional capacity for regulation and management and improving administration of cash benefits and 
social welfare services.  
  
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed project includes three components: (i) pension system administration; (ii) social 
protection program support; and (iii) project management, monitoring and evaluation. 
 
Component 1:
  
PENSION SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION (US$ 8.64 million). 
This component would 
improve the long-term sustainability of the pension system through improving the administration and 
efficiency of the existing pension system institutions, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness in 
collection of pension contributions through the introduction of a monthly pension contribution record-
keeping on the individual basis, building regulatory and supervisory capacities in the newly formed PSA 
and custodial capacities in the NBRM, and improving public knowledge of the pension system through an 
extensive public education campaign.   
 
Component 2:
  
SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAM SUPPORT (US$2.38 million).
 This component 
would support the implementation of social protection reforms and the development of technical and 
organizational capacities for policy formulation and mechanisms to improve resource management and 
service delivery in the MLSP and its strategic departments.  In particular, this component would support the 
development and refinement of overall strategic goals, institutional mandates, financial and business 
planning; strengthen information management and technological capacities in social protection institutions; 
harmonize data systems across key MLSP departments and social protection institutions; establish key 
indicator data to support policy formulation and monitoring of program implementation; and capacity 
building for decentralization modeling, policy feed-back and communication with the public.   
 
Component 3:  PROJECT MANAGEMENT, MONITORING AND EVALUATION (US$0.55 
million).
   This component would ensure effective administration and implementation of the project by 
supporting the operation of a Project Management Unit (PMU) which would report to the Minister of Labor 
and which would be responsible for all the day-to-day project implementation activities.  This component 
also includes the financin
g
 of the front-end-fee of 1% of the loan.  The Government would contribute to 
Page  3
 
 
this component by financing the salaries of the PMU staff, recurrent operating costs and taxes and duties.  
This component would also ensure effective monitoring and evaluation of project activities, achievements 
and outcomes during and after project implementation.
