A.2. Project Objectives 
The primary objective of the project is to help complete the task initiated under DSP aimed at creating the 
enabling conditions for protecting the people downstream and their socio-economic infrastructure from 
high risk of dam failure. It will upgrade the safety status of 47 dams in need of rehabilitation but for which 
emergency and priority measures could not be financed under DSP. Interventions under the project are 
deemed necessary on the basis of the findings of technical investigations undertaken under the DSP, which 
called for urgent action to prevent those dams from entering into an emergency state in the near future. 
Progress towards the project objective would be measured in terms of: (i) the number of people protected 
downstream of each rehabilitated dam, and (ii) achievement of the target Risk Reduction Profile: 
progressive reduction of the overall risk posed by the whole portfolio of the 47 dams to acceptable level 
according to international standards for a potentially affected population of about 120,000 people and 
associated socio-economic infrastructure. 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project will constitute a four-year program for improving the safety of 47 dams, and for establishing an 
effective system capable of monitoring their safety and of providing the necessary operation and 
maintenance. The project will also provide for any gap in safety preparedness measures for the 27 dams 
rehabilitated under DSP. The project is based on an optimized implementation program composed of a mix 
of both structural and non-structural measures.  Structural measures are the rehabilitation works proper,  
require relatively long construction times and represent the greatest part of the cost of the program. Non-
structural dam safety measures include: monitoring, operation and maintenance, emergency preparedness.  
The technique used for designing the project is the optimization, given the available financial and 
managerial resources, of the reduction of the Risk Profile that is an indicator obtained through the 
balancing of structural and non-structural measures.   
The project consists of three components: 
• 
Rehabilitation of Dams: This component will provide for: (i) engineering design of rehabilitation 
activities for 29 dams, including the preparation of an emergency preparedness plan for the 
Yerevan Lake Dam, (ii) implementation of rehabilitation works on 47 dams (29 dams for which 
designs are provided for under this project and 18 dams for which designs were already prepared 
under DSP), and (iii) construction supervision in the course of the rehabilitation of all 47 dams.

(telecommunication equipment, sirens, searchlights, loud speakers) at 56 dams (47 dams 
rehabilitated under this project, 4 dams rehabilitated under DSP and 5 not to be rehabilitated), (ii) 
technical assistance to help WSA design an integrated telecommunication network for all dams, 
prepare the necessary regulations and operational procedures to guide all parties involved in the 
dam safety preparedness network, arrange for annual independent audits of WSA operations and 
accounts, and maintain an independent dam safety expert (iii) training for technical staff involved 
in dam safety O&M, monitoring and emergency preparedness, (iv) basic equipment to allow 
proper operation and maintenance at 55 dams (43 dams rehabilitated under this project 2 dams for 
which no provision has been made under DSP and 10 not to be rehabilitated), and (v) 
improvement of access roads for 16 dams to enable proper maintenance and timely 
implementation of safety measures in case of emergency. 
• 
Project Management: This component will provide for: (i) technical assistance for PIU to co-
ordinate all project interventions, and to provide the support services necessary for timely and 
effective project implementation (procurement of goods and services, financial control, monitoring 
of project activities, preparation of annual work plans, and reporting on the status of project 
implementation and audit), and (ii) incremental operating costs of PIU activities.   
 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The 47 dams to be rehabilitated under the project are located in different parts of the country. None of them 
is located within an environmentally sensitive areas or within the territories of protected areas.  The 
beneficiary population of the project is over 120,000 people who would enjoy increased safety conditions 
after completion of the project.   
 
 
B. Check Environmental Category 
A [
 
], B [X], C [ ], FI [ ] 
 
 
Comments: 
Considering the rehabilitation nature of the project and the type of works to be carried, the negative impacts 
on the environment are expected to be insignificant or minor.  The impact will be limited to: 
 
(i)  
The transport and disposal of inert materials and construction concrete rubbles and debris; 
and 
(ii) 
The use and transport of materials (stone, gravel, soil, etc) from old and/or new quarries. 
 
The positive impacts are, on the other hand, expected to be significant.  Over 120,000 persons (affected 
population) would enjoy better protection and safety after completion of the project.  The water resource 
and the Dam-based socio-economic activities and infrastructures and those in downstream areas would also 
be better protected.  Dam operations will be better managed and sustained (reducing the need for new dams 
and for more impacts on the environment).   Dam warning and emergency systems will be improved and 
O&M function will be strengthened.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
About US$3.9 million will be allocated for implementing emergency and priority measures in 47 dam sites. 
This means an average expenditure for each dam of about USD80,000, showing the limited nature of the  
interventions , (mainly improvement of  spillways and irrigation outlets). As in the ongoing DSP, the  
principal environmental issue faced by the project  is the management and disposal of excavated materials. 
Additionally, the amount of materials to be managed and disposed under IDSP II will be much less than in 
the previous project since no major works on dam bodies are foreseen and in only one case (Kechut dam) a 
temporary building and a borrow pit will be included. Nevertheless, an Environmental Management Plan 
for IDSP II has been prepared, disclosed and consultations are taking place.  All civil works contracts 
envisaged under the project will conform to the requirements under this plan. Necessary permits from the 
Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP) and as needed from the local/regional authorities for all transport, 
disposal, and dumping operations will be part of the contracts. Restoration to quasi-original conditions of 
landscape after completion of construction and rehabilitation works and minimization of air pollution 
emissions during the works will be also part of the contracts. The Water Supply Agency and the PIU will 
be responsible for supervising that the EMP is properly and timely implemented. 
 
Improvements of access to dams are minor (average of $US 20,000 per site) and will not require land 
acquisition. 
 
The primary goal of the project is to improve the safety of dams, conforming to almost all safety aspects 
identified by OP4.37.  Provisions for complying with OP 4.37 included in DSP  will be continued in IDSP 
II and will include retaining the services of an experience international dam specialist hired under the 
project for its whole duration.. Beside evident benefits in terms of safety for people and infrastructure,  the 
project will contribute to the reduction of  erosion of dam sites (included under rehabilitation contracts), 
thereby lengthening the life of the investments and   reducing risks from erosion-induced failures. The 
project will also, through provision of safety and telecommunication equipment, further  implement 
Emergency Preparedness Plans completed under DSP. The project will also, through provision of  O&M 
equipment and improvement of the regulatory framework, improve the sustainability of the dam system. 
Financial sustainability of the system remain part of a larger effort of institutional reform  for the Water 
Supply Agency  (including the creation of Water Users Associations) supported  under another  World 
Bank financed project, the Irrigation Development Project. 
 
Following OPCS note of November 12, 2003, on “Streamlining and Modernization of Project Processing 
and Documentation” , the IDSP II does not require a fresh safeguard review. Nevertheless, it is worth 
repeating that the project is not a category A (as the predecessor DSP) and will maintain the same 
arrangements agreed for DSP namely: (i) retain the services of an international dam specialist to support 
and review WSA and PIU activities during the whole length of project implementation (that was the main 
reason for which DSP was not required to have a panel of experts); and (ii) avoiding any works and activity 
that would exceed the original storage capacity or use of the storage capacity that would inevitably lead to 
the necessity of notification to riparian states  (DSP was waived from notification to riparian states and 
IDSP II does not foresee to finance any activity with such characteristics). 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
In addition to benefits in terms of safety for people and infrastructure,  the project will contribute to the 
reduction of  erosion of dam sites (included under rehabilitation contracts), thereby lengthening the life of 
the investments and   reducing risks from erosion-induced failures. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
N/A 
Page  6
 
 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
An Environmental Management Plan was developed and disclosed. It which specifies roles and 
responsibilities for implementation and enforcement. Mitigation measures are related mostly to safe 
transportation and disposal of construction materials and waste and debris, landscaping (restoring to 
original conditions) of construction site. The EMP also mentions obtaining in time from Ministry of Nature 
Protection and other responsible agencies permits for opening and use of quarries, and for disposal of 
excavated materials and constructions wastes.  
 
The same institutions and agencies implementing DSP and Irrigation Development Project will be 
responsible for IDSP II as well.  The Borrower’s institutional capacity is demonstrated by the satisfactory 
implementation of the ongoing operations. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Communities, Water User Associations representing water using farmers, as well as Water Supply Agency 
under the State Water Committee and Emergency Management Agency of Armenia are the major 
stakeholders of the project. Each of them has a specific role and responsibility in the project. Under IDP a 
training program has being  implemented for WSA staff which also incorporates elements of safeguard 
issues. Before starting construction works at project sites public awareness meetings will be conducted with 
population of communities located downstream of dams. In addition, the EMP was advertised in national 
newspapers and made available to beneficiaries and NGOs.

sent? 
  
What are the reasons for the exception? 
 
 
Please explain: In general the projects, dealing with infrastructures that store 
water that in some cases ultimately flow into international rivers as Arax, triggers 
this OP.  As with DSP I, an exception to the notification requirements for riparian 
countries is warranted. One of the cases when exception is granted is when the 
project concerns “any ongoing schemes, projects involving additions or 
alterations that require rehabilitation, construction, or other changes that in the 
judgment of the Bank: (i) will not adversely change the quality or quantity of 
water flows to the other riparians; and (ii) will not be adversely affected by the 
other riparians' possible water use”.  This exception applies only to “minor 
additions or alterations to the ongoing scheme” and does not cover “works and 
activities that would exceed the original scheme, change its nature, or so alter or 
expand its scope and extent as to make it appear a new or different scheme”.  The 
Irrigation Dam Safety Project II fits fully such description as it predecessor DSP I 
that, for the same reason, was waived from the requirement of communications to 
riparian states. 
  
Has the RVP approved such an exception? 
 
Since this is a repeater project the new RVP approval is not required.
