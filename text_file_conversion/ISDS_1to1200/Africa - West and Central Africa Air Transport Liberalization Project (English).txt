B.  Project Objectives
 
The main project objective is to 
create a safe
1
 and secure
2
 environment for air transport in West and 
Central Africa (WCA)
 that will allow African airlines to competitively access regional and worldwide 
markets. This objective will be measured with two main tools: (i) on aviation safety aspects, country 
audits conducted by the ICAO on compliance with provisions of the International Civil Aviation 
convention; (ii) on security aspects, results of the ICAO audits and US Transport Security Administration 
assessments of compliance with ICAO requirements. 
 
C.  Project Description 
The project supports the development of a regional Air Transport Program within the context of the 
Yamoussoukro Decision (YD) implementation. It will complement the work that will be undertaken by 
regional institutions (with donors’ support) in the area of 
Air Transport Economic Regulation 
harmonization 
while focusing on Aviation and airport safety and security. The project will be 
implemented at two levels: 
regional and national, 
using a regional approach with the required flexibility 
to take into account individual country needs. Such an approach will ensure coordinated and sustainable 
implementation of air transport liberalization and foster economic development and regional integration. 
  
 
The two Secretariat Units located within ECOWAS and CEMAC will have overall project management 
responsibilities so as to promote effective coordination and harmonization at the regional level and bolster

 Air Transport Safety (ICAO): A condition in which the risk of harm or damage is limited to an acceptable level. 
2
 Air Transport Security (ICAO): A combination of measures and human and material resources intended to 
safeguard civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference.

ECOWAS and CEMAC roles as regional institutions. The proposed activities for this project will cover 
the following three areas: 
 
\01fi
Development of regional safety oversight capacities;  
\01fi
Strengthening of Civil Aviation Authorities (CAAs) safety oversight capacities; and 
\01fi
Enhancement of national and regional security oversight standards.
 
 
a. 
Development of regional safety oversight capacities:
  
In order to address the lack of resources 
and expertise of CAAs which preclude them from complying with the safety and security standards 
defined by the ICAO, CAAs from other regions of the world (e.g. East Asia) have entered into 
Cooperative Development of Operational Safety and Continued Airworthiness (COSCAP) agreements 
with ICAO. These agreements have resulted in the pooling of local resources through the creation of 
regional COSCAPs units which have, when required, carried out airplanes and pilots certification and 
surveillance functions on behalf of individual States’ CAAs.   
 
Under this approach, the region’s countries have agreed to assemble in three groups, namely: In 
ECOWAS through: (i) Union Economique et Monétaire de l’Ouest Africain (UEMOA) plus Mauritania 
and (ii) Banjul Accord Group
3
, and, (iii) CEMAC plus Sao Tome & Principe. Each group will create a 
COSCAP unit with the technical assistance of the ICAO
4
 in order to address the deficiencies identified in 
the safety audits carried out recently and, eventually, reach full ICAO compliance on these matters
5
. 
 
The estimated 
cost for this activity is USD 12.4 million
.    
 
b. 
Strengthening of CAAs safety oversight capacities:
 Each country’s CAA will require technical 
assistance in order to be able to adopt and utilize harmonized aviation code and regulations as well as 
surveillance and certification programs. Most of them will have to be restructured in order to achieve 
financial and operational autonomy and, thus, ensure the sustainability of the proposed reforms. Finally, 
staff training and other activities in support of the implementation of individual ICAO Audit Corrective 
Action Plans will have to be undertaken. These efforts will be targeted both at the local Ministry of 
Transports and CAAs as follows: 
\01fi
Adjustment of Ministry of Transports’ technical regulation monitoring capacity - Within the 
framework of the proposed reforms, the role played by the Ministries of Transport as technical 
regulator will be reviewed in order to adapt their individual structure to the expanded role of local 
and regional oversight bodies (i.e.; Regional Aviation Safety Agency and National CAAs).
 
\01fi
Strengthening of the CAAs - Several issues will have to be reviewed in order to strengthen 
national CAAs: 
Gfi
Legal status
: Type of legal structure, minimal funding requirements;
 
Gfi
Organization
: Implementation of model structure compliant with ICAO recommendations;
 
Gfi
Procedures
 (certification, surveillance): Implementation of models compliant with SARPs; 
 
Gfi
Training Program
: Implementation of plan defined by COSCAPs;
 
Gfi
Financing Structure: 
Implementation of recommendations defined at regional levels.
 
 
The estimated 
cost for this activity is USD 4.3 million
.   
                                                          
 
3
 The Banjul Accord group is comprised of the following countries: Cape Verde, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria 
and Sierra Leone  
4
 Such agreement has already been concluded in September 2003 between the UEMOA countries and ICAO. 
5
 
The countries of West and Central Africa both individually and as members of various sub-regional groups are at different 
stages of implementation of reforms for air transport liberalization. Only a couple of states (Ghana, Cape Verde), although a f
ew 
others are working towards it, have met ICAO safety compliance and have attained the FAA’s International Aviation Safety 
Assessment (IASA) Category 1 rating. UEMOA is the most advanced in terms of economic regulations.

c. 
Enhancement of national and regional security oversight standards: 
This activity will 
involve establishing appropriate aviation security legislation, development of security programs (national, 
airports, airlines), provision of security equipment at the main international airports, and capacity 
building. The main areas of focus of this program will be: 
a. 
Implementation of measures to reinforce the security at the various access points to the airport 
(identification badges, security cameras, security fences, vehicles and communications systems); 
b. 
Training of security personnel; 
c. 
Development of airport security; and 
d. 
Development of financial means to finance airport security improvements. 
A preliminary estimate about the total cost for the regions sets the 
required funds at about USD 20 
million.
 In addition, each COSCAP will add an 
additional USD 1 million
 for regional security activities.

Current donor (France, EU) participation to the regional component (COSCAP) is estimated 
between USD 4-5 million. 
 
 
D.  Project location 
Currently, financed under an IDF grant (P077772), the Technical Bureau for Air Transport of ECOWAS 
is located in Abuja, Nigeria, and the Technical Unit for CEMAC in Bangui, Central Africa Republic. 
However, the three locations of proposed safety capacity building programs, the three COSCAP of 
UEMOA, CEMAC, and BANJUL, will have to be determined. 
The proposed capacity building of national and regional security oversights location will also be 
determined.  Of the 23 States in the three regions, only certain will be identified of national security 
programs. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
The overall institutional capacity for implementation, based on past experience with two Institutional 
Development Fund (IDF) grants totaling US$ 785,000 between December 2000 and June 2002, is to be 
considered mediocre (ECOWAS) and poor (CEMAC). However, given the fact that most of the project 
concerns capacity building and regulatory work, the borrower’s capacity should not impact safeguard 
policies.
