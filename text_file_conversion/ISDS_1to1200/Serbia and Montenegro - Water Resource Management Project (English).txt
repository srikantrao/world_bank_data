B.  Project Objectives
In order to address the issues of water resources management in Serbia, the project’s main 
objectives are: (a) to reduce the risk of damage to land, crops, property and infrastructure from 
flooding; (b) to increase agricultural pr
oductivity through support 
to high priority rehabilitation
of drainage and irrigation infrastructure; and (c) to improve water resources management and 
strengthen the associated water resource management institutions and policies.
The above objectives are
 in accordance with the recommendations of current policy studies, as 
agreed by MAFWM, notably those of the Policy Advisory Unit under the EU funded European 
Agency for Reconstruction (EAR).  Key performance indicators would be: (a) areas protected 
against
 flooding and waterlogging, and number of farmers benefiting; (b) increase in crop 
production resulting from (a); (c)  the results of studies of irrigation requirements and 
constraints, and the development of a strategy and program for irrigation rehabilit
ation and 
development; (d) the formulation of a strategy and program for development in the areas of flood 
control, drainage,  and irrigation; (e) the development of environmental reclamation and 
protection mitigation plans; and (f) finalizing the draft le
gislation on aspects of the agricultural 
water sector, especially regarding WUAs
.

C.  Project Description
The project size is about US$ 30 million consisting of a $25 million credit and a $5 million 
borrower contribution. The  project has a five year im
plementation period. The land benefiting 
from improved drainage is about  350,000 ha, with 200,000 inhabitants benefiting from 
improved flood protection. The returns to the economy, from increased agricultural productivity, 
increased incomes and associated
 fiscal benefits, and reduced losses from flooding, would  be 
substantial
. 
The main components would include:
Component 1. Rehabilitation and Improvement of Water Resources Infrastructure
.
The rehabilitation and improvement works would include: (a) restit
ution of the flood control 
defenses and the upgrading of the flood forecasting facilities; (b) restitution of the drainage 
facilities; and (c) a construction of pilot minor irrigation systems.
Component 2. Technical Assistance 
This component would includ
e: (a) a study for requirements and constraints for future irrigation 
sub
-
sector development, and the initiation of measures to remove these constraints, including a 
feasibility study of priority areas and for a pilot minor irrigation system; (b) instituti
onal reform,  
capacity building, and improved water sector management; (c) upgrading of the flood forecasting 
and warning system; and (d) training.
Component 3. Equipment and Vehicles
This would include provision of equipment for flood forecasting and war
ning system, O&M and 
office equipment and vehicles.
D.  Project location
Although the project has a country
-
wide coverage, all of the drainage and flood control works 
(about 80% of the planned investments) will be concentrated in the northern Vojvodina r
egion, 
and the remaining for pilot irrigation management will be concentrated in the southern region.  
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The implementing agency, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management and i
ts 
subordinate Departments and Directorates are supported by long established technical institutes 
and the universities. These agencies at present suffer from diminished professional staff due to 
migration, and equipment and facilities also require moderni
zation and rehabilitation.  Also, 
there is a need to reorganize the sector and introduce a more participatory and integrated 
approach to water management.
In spite of these shortcomings, there is still a viable professional specialist cadre in Serbia to 
s
ustain the reorganisation and reinstatement of agriculture given stability and funding provision.  
However, these institutions need to be familiarized and trained on the Bank ‘s Safeguard 
Policies.

If Applicable, How Might It Apply?
[YES ]
Environmental Assessment
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.01)
During project preparation environmental and social assessments will be prepared
and submitted to the Bank. The EA will look at all environmental issues related to 
this project specially the soil and water pollution in areas of intervention.  A link 
will be established with a proposed GEF
-
funded Danube River Enterprise 
Pollution Prote
ction Project. It is expected that the Environmental Management 
Plan (EMP) will include two parts: a specific one focusing on the northern region 
where most of the investment for flood and drainage rehabilitation works will be 
located; and a generic one fo
r pilot irrigation sub
-
projects, which will be located 
in the southern part of the country and will be selected on the basis of the demand 
of farmers.

Natural Habitats

Involuntary Resettlement
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.12)
There is such a low probability for the irrigation activities to trigger this OP, that 
it is unlikely the project will present land acquisition or resettlement issues
. There 
are plentiful choices for pilot areas; they will be selected to avoid land 
acquisition.

Safety of Dams
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.37)
During project preparation, dam safety analyses will b
e focused specifically in 
catchment areas where investments are planned (e.g. 80% of the financing in the 
northern part of the country, and part of the remaining funding in any smaller 
pilot areas in the South.)  At this time we do not expect to finance fl
ood protection 
and drainage sub
-
projects in such a widespread nature as to require analysis of all 
dams in the country; only in focused areas.
[NO]
Cultural Property
 (draft OP 4.11 
-
OPN 11.03
)
Cultural property OP will be covered as part of the EA. The pro
ject is not 
expected to finance construction activities in cultural or historical sites. 
Procedures to deal with chance finds will be spelled out in the EMP.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the

Projects on International Waterways
 (
OP
/
BP
/
GP
7.50)
The project is on international waterways. However, since the investments 
expected under the project are mostly rehabilitation and improvement of existing 
flood control and drainage schemes, they will not change the volume 
of 
extraction/discharge of water or quality of water. The team will consult with 
Legal to see whether a waiver to notification is appropriate.
